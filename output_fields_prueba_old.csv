10.1002/jmv.29240;The imperative for quality control programs in Monkeypox virus DNA testing by PCR: CIBERINFEC quality control.;To evaluate molecular assays for Mpox diagnosis available in various clinical microbiology services in Spain through a quality control (QC) approach. A total of 14 centers from across Spain participated in the study. The Reference Laboratory dispatched eight serum samples and eight nucleic acid extracts to each participating center. Some samples were spiked with Mpox or Vaccinia virus to mimic positive samples for Mpox or other orthopox viruses. Participating centers provided information on the results obtained, as well as the laboratory methods used. Among the 14 participating centers seven different commercial assays were employed, with the most commonly used kit being LightMix Modular Orthopox/Monkeypox (Mpox) Virus (Roche®). Of the 12 centers conducting Mpox determinations, concordance ranged from 62.5% (n = 1) to 100% (n = 11) for eluates and from 75.0% (n = 1) to 100% (n = 10) for serum. Among the 10 centers performing Orthopoxvirus determinations, a 100% concordance was observed for eluates, while for serum, concordance ranged from 87.5% (n = 6) to 100% (n = 4). Repeatedly, 6 different centers reported a false negative in serum samples for Orthopoxvirus diagnosis, particularly in a sample with borderline Ct  = 39. Conversely, one center, using the TaqMan™ Mpox Virus Microbe Detection Assay (Thermo Fisher), reported false positives in Mpox diagnosis for samples spiked with vaccinia virus due to cross-reactions. We observed a positive correlation of various diagnostic assays for Mpox used by the participating centers with the reference values. Our results highlight the significance of standardization, validation, and ongoing QC in the microbiological diagnosis of infectious diseases, which might be particularly relevant for emerging viruses.;2023;Nov;Journal of medical virology;"de Salazar A; Martínez MJ; Navero-Castillejos J; Negredo A; Galán JC; Rojo Molinero E; Lagarejos E; Muñoz-Almagro C; Hernández Rodríguez Á; Lepe JA; Antón Pagarolas A; Pérez Castro S; Zamora Cintas MI; Domínguez-Gil González M; Niubó-Bosch J; Gutiérrez Arroyo A; Vazquez A; García F; Sánchez-Seco Fariñas MP";"de Salazar A; Martínez MJ; Navero-Castillejos J; Negredo A; Galán JC; Rojo Molinero E; Lagarejos E; Muñoz-Almagro C; Hernández Rodríguez Á; Lepe JA; Antón Pagarolas A; Pérez Castro S; Zamora Cintas MI; Domínguez-Gil González M; Niubó-Bosch J; Gutiérrez Arroyo A; Vazquez A; García F; Sánchez-Seco Fariñas MP.

CPE (n = 247) and CRPA (n = 170) isolates were prospectively collected from patients admitted to 8 Spanish hospitals. Susceptibility to cefepime-taniborbactam and comparators was determined by broth microdilution. Cefepime-taniborbactam was the most active agent, inhibiting 97.6% of CPE and 67.1% of CRPA (MICs ≤ 8/4 mg/L). All isolates with cefepime-taniborbactam MIC > 8/4 mg/L (5 CPE and 52 CRPA) and a subset with MIC ≤ 8/4 mg/L (23 CPE and 24 CRPA) were characterized by whole genome sequencing. A reduced cefepime-taniborbactam activity was found in two KPC-ST307-Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates with altered porins [KPC-62-K. pneumoniae (OmpA, OmpR/EnvZ), KPC-150-K. pneumoniae (OmpK35, OmpK36)] and one each ST133-VIM-1-Enterobacter hormaechei with altered OmpD, OmpR, and OmpC; IMP-8-ST24-Enterobacter asburiae; and NDM-5-Escherichia coli with an YRIN-inserted PBP3 and a mutated PBP2. Among the P. aeruginosa (68/76), elevated cefepime-taniborbactam MICs were mostly associated with GES-5-ST235, OXA-2+VIM-2-ST235, and OXA-2+VIM-20-ST175 isolates also carrying mutations in PBP3, efflux pump (mexR, mexZ) and AmpC (mpl) regulators, and non-carbapenemase-ST175 isolates with AmpD-T139M and PBP3-R504C mutations. Overall, accumulation of these mutations was frequently detected among non-carbapenemase producers. The reduced cefepime-taniborbactam activity among the minority of isolates with elevated cefepime-taniborbactam MICs is not only due to IMP carbapenemases but also to the accumulation of multiple resistance mechanisms, including PBP and porin mutations in CPE and chromosomal mutations leading to efflux pumps up-regulation, AmpC overexpression, and PBP modifications in P. aeruginosa.";2024;Feb;European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology;"Hernández-García M; García-Castillo M; Nieto-Torres M; Bou G; Ocampo-Sosa A; Pitart C; Gracia-Ahufinger I; Mulet X; Pascual Á; Tormo N; Oliver A; Ruiz-Garbajosa P; Cantón R";"Hernández-García M; García-Castillo M; Nieto-Torres M; Bou G; Ocampo-Sosa A; Pitart C; Gracia-Ahufinger I; Mulet X; Pascual Á; Tormo N; Oliver A; Ruiz-Garbajosa P; Cantón R.

We aimed to evaluate outcomes of P. aeruginosa bacteremia among old adults (≥ 80 years). We included the 464/2394 (19%) older adults from a retrospective multinational (9 countries, 25 centers) cohort study of individuals hospitalized with P. aeruginosa bacteremia. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate risk factors for 30-day mortality among older adults. Among 464 adults aged ≥ 80 years, the mean age was 84.61 (SD 3.98) years, and 274 (59%) were men. Compared to younger patients, ≥ 80 years adults had lower Charlson score; were less likely to have nosocomial acquisition; and more likely to have urinary source. Thirty-day mortality was 30%, versus 27% among patients 65-79 years (n = 894) and 25% among patients < 65 years (n = 1036). Multivariate analysis for predictors of mortality among patients ≥ 80 years, demonstrated higher SOFA score (odds ratio [OR] 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-1.51, p < 0.001), corticosteroid therapy (OR 3.15, 95% CI: 1.24-8.01, p = 0.016) and hospital acquired P. aeruginosa bacteremia (OR 2.30, 95% CI: 1.33-3.98, p = 0.003) as predictors. Appropriate empirical therapy within 24 h, type of definitive anti-pseudomonal drug, and type of regimen (monotherapy or combination) were not associated with 30-day mortality. In older adults with P. aeruginosa bacteremia, background conditions, place of acquisition, and disease severity are associated with mortality, rather than the antimicrobial regimen. In this regard, preventive efforts and early diagnosis before organ failure develops might be beneficial for improving outcomes.";2023;Aug;Infection;"Atamna A; Margalit I; Ayada G; Babich T; Naucler P; Valik JK; Giske CG; Benito N; Cardona R; Rivera A; Pulcini C; Fattah MA; Haquin J; Macgowan A; Chazan B; Yanovskay A; Ami RB; Landes M; Nesher L; Zaidman-Shimshovitz A; McCarthy K; Paterson DL; Tacconelli E; Buhl M; Mauer S; Rodríguez-Baño J; de Cueto M; Oliver A; de Gopegui ER; Cano A; Machuca I; Gozalo-Marguello M; Martinez-Martinez L; Gonzalez-Barbera EM; Alfaro IG; Salavert M; Beovic B; Saje A; Mueller-Premru M; Pagani L; Vitrat V; Kofteridis D; Zacharioudaki M; Maraki S; Weissman Y; Paul M; Dickstei Y; Yahav D";"Atamna A; Margalit I; Ayada G; Babich T; Naucler P; Valik JK; Giske CG; Benito N; Cardona R; Rivera A; Pulcini C; Fattah MA; Haquin J; Macgowan A; Chazan B; Yanovskay A; Ami RB; Landes M; Nesher L; Zaidman-Shimshovitz A; McCarthy K; Paterson DL; Tacconelli E; Buhl M; Mauer S; Rodríguez-Baño J; de Cueto M; Oliver A; de Gopegui ER; Cano A; Machuca I; Gozalo-Marguello M; Martinez-Martinez L; Gonzalez-Barbera EM; Alfaro IG; Salavert M; Beovic B; Saje A; Mueller-Premru M; Pagani L; Vitrat V; Kofteridis D; Zacharioudaki M; Maraki S; Weissman Y; Paul M; Dickstei Y; Yahav D.

The objective was to provide detailed information about the clinical and molecular epidemiological features of nosocomial, HCA and CA infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CP-Kp) and Escherichia coli (CP-Ec). A prospective cohort study was performed in 59 Spanish hospitals from February to March 2019, including the first 10 consecutive patients from whom CP-Kp or CP-Ec were isolated. Patients were stratified according to acquisition type. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify the impact of acquisition type in 30-day mortality. Overall, 386 patients were included (363 [94%] with CP-Kp and 23 [6%] CP-Ec); in 296 patients (76.3%), the CPE was causing an infection. Acquisition was CA in 31 (8.0%) patients, HCA in 183 (47.4%) and nosocomial in 172 (48.3%). Among patients with a HCA acquisition, 100 (54.6%) had been previously admitted to hospital and 71 (38.8%) were nursing home residents. Urinary tract infections accounted for 19/23 (82.6%), 89/130 (68.5%) and 42/143 (29.4%) of CA, HCA and nosocomial infections, respectively. Overall, 68 infections (23%) were bacteremia (8.7%, 17.7% and 30.1% of CA, HCA and nosocomial, respectively). Mortality in infections was 28% (13%, 14.6% and 42.7% of CA, HCA and nosocomial, respectively). Nosocomial bloodstream infections were associated with increased odds for mortality (adjusted OR, 4.00; 95%CI 1.21-13.19). HCA and CA infections caused by CPE are frequent and clinically significant. This information may be useful for a better understanding of the epidemiology of CPE.";2024;Dec;Infection;"Salamanca-Rivera E; Palacios-Baena ZR; Cañada JE; Moure Z; Pérez-Vázquez M; Calvo-Montes J; Martínez-Martínez L; Cantón R; Ruiz Carrascoso G; Pitart C; Navarro F; Bou G; Mulet X; González-López JJ; Sivianes F; Delgado-Valverde M; Pascual Á; Oteo-Iglesias J; Rodríguez-Baño J";"Salamanca-Rivera E; Palacios-Baena ZR; Cañada JE; Moure Z; Pérez-Vázquez M; Calvo-Montes J; Martínez-Martínez L; Cantón R; Ruiz Carrascoso G; Pitart C; Navarro F; Bou G; Mulet X; González-López JJ; Sivianes F; Delgado-Valverde M; Pascual Á; Oteo-Iglesias J; Rodríguez-Baño J.

10.1007/s15010-024-02313-x;Impact of multidrug resistance on the virulence and fitness of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: a microbiological and clinical perspective.;Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common nosocomial pathogens and part of the top emergent species associated with antimicrobial resistance that has become one of the greatest threat to public health in the twenty-first century. This bacterium is provided with a wide set of virulence factors that contribute to pathogenesis in acute and chronic infections. This review aims to summarize the impact of multidrug resistance on the virulence and fitness of P. aeruginosa. Although it is generally assumed that acquisition of resistant determinants is associated with a fitness cost, several studies support that resistance mutations may not be associated with a decrease in virulence and/or that certain compensatory mutations may allow multidrug resistance strains to recover their initial fitness. We discuss the interplay between resistance profiles and virulence from a microbiological perspective but also the clinical consequences in outcomes and the economic impact.;2024;Aug;Infection;"Sendra E; Fernández-Muñoz A; Zamorano L; Oliver A; Horcajada JP; Juan C; Gómez-Zorrilla S";"Sendra E; Fernández-Muñoz A; Zamorano L; Oliver A; Horcajada JP; Juan C; Gómez-Zorrilla S.

10.1007/s40121-022-00657-1;Duration of Treatment for Pseudomonas aeruginosa Bacteremia: a Retrospective Study.;"There is no consensus regarding optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia. We aimed to evaluate the impact of short antibiotic course. We present a retrospective multicenter study including patients with P. aeruginosa bacteremia during 2009-2015. We evaluated outcomes of patients treated with short (6-10 days) versus long (11-15 days) antibiotic courses. The primary outcome was a composite of 30-day mortality or bacteremia recurrence and/or persistence. Univariate and inverse probability treatment-weighted (IPTW) adjusted multivariate analysis for the primary outcome was performed. To avoid immortal time bias, the landmark method was used. We included 657 patients; 273 received a short antibiotic course and 384 a long course. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics of patients. The composite primary outcome occurred in 61/384 patients in the long-treatment group (16%) versus 32/273 in the short-treatment group (12%) (p = 0.131). Mortality accounted for 41/384 (11%) versus 25/273 (9%) of cases, respectively. Length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the short group [median 13 days, interquartile range (IQR) 9-21 days, versus median 15 days, IQR 11-26 days, p = 0.002]. Ten patients in the long group discontinued antibiotic therapy owing to adverse events, compared with none in the short group. On univariate and multivariate analyses, duration of therapy was not associated with the primary outcome. In this retrospective study, 6-10 days of antibiotic course for P. aeruginosa bacteremia were as effective as longer courses in terms of survival and recurrence. Shorter therapy was associated with reduced length of stay and less drug discontinuation.";2022;Aug;Infectious diseases and therapy;"Babich T; Naucler P; Valik JK; Giske CG; Benito N; Cardona R; Rivera A; Pulcini C; Fattah MA; Haquin J; Macgowan A; Grier S; Chazan B; Yanovskay A; Ami RB; Landes M; Nesher L; Zaidman-Shimshovitz A; McCarthy K; Paterson DL; Tacconelli E; Buhl M; Mauer S; Rodríguez-Baño J; de Cueto M; Oliver A; de Gopegui ER; Cano A; Machuca I; Gozalo-Marguello M; Martinez-Martinez L; Gonzalez-Barbera EM; Alfaro IG; Salavert M; Beovic B; Saje A; Mueller-Premru M; Pagani L; Vitrat V; Kofteridis D; Zacharioudaki M; Maraki S; Weissman Y; Paul M; Dickstein Y; Leibovici L; Yahav D";"Babich T; Naucler P; Valik JK; Giske CG; Benito N; Cardona R; Rivera A; Pulcini C; Fattah MA; Haquin J; Macgowan A; Grier S; Chazan B; Yanovskay A; Ami RB; Landes M; Nesher L; Zaidman-Shimshovitz A; McCarthy K; Paterson DL; Tacconelli E; Buhl M; Mauer S; Rodríguez-Baño J; de Cueto M; Oliver A; de Gopegui ER; Cano A; Machuca I; Gozalo-Marguello M; Martinez-Martinez L; Gonzalez-Barbera EM; Alfaro IG; Salavert M; Beovic B; Saje A; Mueller-Premru M; Pagani L; Vitrat V; Kofteridis D; Zacharioudaki M; Maraki S; Weissman Y; Paul M; Dickstein Y; Leibovici L; Yahav D.

10.1007/s40265-024-02102-8;The Challenge of Treating Infections Caused by Metallo-β-Lactamase-Producing Gram-Negative Bacteria: A Narrative Review.;"Gram-negative multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, including Enterobacterales, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, pose a significant challenge in clinical practice. Infections caused by metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing Gram-negative organisms, in particular, require careful consideration due to their complexity and varied prevalence, given that the microbiological diagnosis of these pathogens is intricate and compounded by challenges in assessing the efficacy of anti-MBL antimicrobials. We discuss both established and new approaches in the treatment of MBL-producing Gram-negative infections, focusing on 3 strategies: colistin; the recently approved combination of aztreonam with avibactam (or with ceftazidime/avibactam); and cefiderocol. Despite its significant activity against various Gram-negative pathogens, the efficacy of colistin is limited by resistance mechanisms, while nephrotoxicity and acute renal injury call for careful dosing and monitoring in clinical practice. Aztreonam combined with avibactam (or with avibactam/ceftazidime if aztreonam plus avibactam is not available) exhibits potent activity against MBL-producing Gram-negative pathogens. Cefiderocol in monotherapy is effective against a wide range of multidrug-resistant organisms, including MBL producers, and favorable clinical outcomes have been observed in various clinical trials and case series. After examining scientific evidence in the management of infections caused by MBL-producing Gram-negative bacteria, we have developed a comprehensive clinical algorithm to guide therapeutic decision making. We recommend reserving colistin as a last-resort option for MDR Gram-negative infections. Cefiderocol and aztreonam/avibactam represent favorable options against MBL-producing pathogens. In the case of P. aeruginosa with MBL-producing enzymes and with difficult-to-treat resistance, cefiderocol is the preferred option. Further research is needed to optimize treatment strategies and minimize resistance.";2024;Dec;Drugs;"Hidalgo-Tenorio C; Bou G; Oliver A; Rodríguez-Aguirregabiria M; Salavert M; Martínez-Martínez L";"Hidalgo-Tenorio C; Bou G; Oliver A; Rodríguez-Aguirregabiria M; Salavert M; Martínez-Martínez L.

10.1016/j.bioflm.2024.100231;Collateral susceptibility-guided alternation of ceftolozane/tazobactam with imipenem prevents resistance development in XDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms.;New combinations of β-lactams and β-lactamase inhibitors, such as ceftolozane/tazobactam could be useful to combat biofilm-driven chronic infections by extensively resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa but resistance development by mutations in the Ω-loop of AmpC has been described. However, these mutations confer collateral susceptibility to carbapenems. Thus we aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and the prevention of resistance development of regimen alternating ceftolozane/tazobactam and imipenem. A carbapenem-resistant XDR P. aeruginosa clinical strain (ST175, 104-B7) and its isogenic imipenem-susceptible ceftolozane/tazobactam-resistant mutant derivative (AmpC T96I, 104-I9) were used. Experiments of single strains and mixed (104-B7 and 104-I9, 1:0.01 ratio) biofilms were performed. 48h biofilms (flow cell system) were treated for 6 days with either ceftolozane/tazobactam, 4/4 mg/L or the alternation of ceftolozane/tazobactam (2 days)-imipenem 4 mg/L (2 days) - ceftolozane/tazobactam (2 days). After treatment, biofilms were collected and plated on Mueller-Hinton agar± ceftolozane/tazobactam 4/4 mg/L. Structural dynamics were monitored using confocal laser scanning microscopy and images were processed with IMARIS software. At least, three independent triplicate experiments per condition were performed. Emerging resistant mutants were characterized through whole genome sequencing (Illumina). Ceftolozane/tazobactam monotherapy failed to reduce the biofilms of the 104-B7 XDR strain and led to the selection of resistant mutants that showed AmpC Ω-loop mutations (T96I, L244R or aa236Δ7). On the contrary, alternation with imipenem enhanced activity (3 Logs reduction at day 6) and prevented the emergence of ceftolozane/tazobactam-resistant mutants. Likewise, treatment with ceftolozane/tazobactam dramatically amplified the resistant strain 104-I9 in mixed biofilms (>90 % of the population), while the alternation regimen counterselected it. Collateral susceptibility-guided alternation of ceftolozane/tazobactam with imipenem effectively prevented the selection of resistant mutants and thus could be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of P. aeruginosa XDR chronic infections.;2024;Dec;Biofilm;"Fernández-Billón M; Jordana-Lluch E; Llambías-Cabot AE; Gomis-Font MA; Fraile-Ribot P; Torrandell RI; Colman-Vega PJ; Murillo Ó; Macià MD; Oliver A";"Fernández-Billón M; Jordana-Lluch E; Llambías-Cabot AE; Gomis-Font MA; Fraile-Ribot P; Torrandell RI; Colman-Vega PJ; Murillo Ó; Macià MD; Oliver A.

10.1016/j.bios.2024.116341;OriPlex: Origami-enabled multiplexed detection of respiratory pathogens.;Origami biosensors leverage paper foldability to develop total analysis systems integrated in a single piece of paper. This capability can also be utilized to incorporate additional features that would be difficult to achieve with rigid substrates. In this article, we report a new design for 3D origami biosensors called OriPlex, which leverages the foldability of filter paper for the multiplexed detection of bacterial pathogens. OriPlex immunosensors detect pathogens by folding nanoparticle reservoirs containing different types of nanoprobes. This releases antibody-coated nanoparticles in a central channel where targets are captured through physical interactions. The OriPlex concept was demonstrated by detecting the respiratory pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) with a limit of detection of 3.4·103 cfu mL-1 and 1.4·102 cfu mL-1, respectively, and with a turn-around time of 25 min. Remarkably, the OriPlex biosensors allowed the multiplexed detection of both pathogens spiked into real bronchial aspirate (BAS) samples at a concentration of 105 cfu mL-1 (clinical infection threshold), thus demonstrating their suitability for diagnosing lower tract respiratory infections. The results shown here pave the way for implementing OriPlex biosensors as a screening test for detecting superbugs requiring personalized antibiotics in suspected cases of nosocomial pneumonia.;2024;Aug;Biosensors & bioelectronics;"Vaquer A; Adrover-Jaume C; Clemente A; Viana J; Rodríguez R; Rojo-Molinero E; Oliver A; de la Rica R";"Vaquer A; Adrover-Jaume C; Clemente A; Viana J; Rodríguez R; Rojo-Molinero E; Oliver A; de la Rica R.

We studied the available (n = 104) C parapsilosis isolates from patients admitted to the Son Espases reference hospital in the Balearic Islands from 1 April 2019 to 30 November 2020. Isolates were sourced from 70 patients: catheter (n = 41), blood cultures (n = 37), lower respiratory tract (n = 15), intra-abdominal (n = 8), and other samples (n = 3). Isolates were genotyped and tested for antifungal susceptibilities to amphotericin B, triazoles, anidulafungin, and micafungin using EUCAST E.Def 7.3.2. The ERG11 gene was sequenced in fluconazole-resistant isolates. Among the 104 isolates, fluconazole and voriconazole resistance was found in 87 (84%) and 30 (29%) isolates, respectively; all isolates were fully susceptible to echinocandins and amphotericin B. All fluconazole-resistant isolates harboured the Y132F substitution in the ERG11 gene and were grouped into 11 clonally related genotypes. A genotype accounted for 70% (61/87) of fluconazole-resistant isolates. Genotypes involving the fluconazole-resistant isolates were different from those found in the remaining fluconazole-susceptible genotypes. Fifty-six patients harboured fluconazole-resistant genotypes, and 35 of the 56 had candidaemia (48%), abdominal candidiasis (17%), or other forms of candidiasis (35%). Only 20% of the study patients infected by fluconazole-resistant genotypes had a history of azole use. Fluconazole resistance in C parapsilosis isolates from patients admitted to this reference hospital is not attributable to prior azole use, but rather to the presence of a group of fluconazole-resistant C parapsilosis genotypes that have become endemic.";2022;Aug;Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases;"Alcoceba E; Gómez A; Lara-Esbrí P; Oliver A; Beltrán AF; Ayestarán I; Muñoz P; Escribano P; Guinea J";"Alcoceba E; Gómez A; Lara-Esbrí P; Oliver A; Beltrán AF; Ayestarán I; Muñoz P; Escribano P; Guinea J.

10.1016/j.cmi.2022.11.014;Cefiderocol resistance genomics in sequential chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from cystic fibrosis patients.;To evaluate the activity of cefiderocol against sequential P. aeruginosa isolates from chronically-infected cystic fibrosis patients as well as to investigate the potential mechanisms involved in resistance through whole genome sequencing. Three sequential P. aeruginosa isolates from each of 50 chronically-colonized cystic fibrosis patients were studied. MICs for novel and classical antipseudomonal agents were determined by broth microdilution and whole genome sequences (n = 150) were obtained to investigate the presence of mutations within a set of chromosomal genes involved in P. aeruginosa antibiotic resistance (n = 40) and iron uptake (n = 120). Cefiderocol showed the lowest MIC50/90 values and its susceptibility rate was comparable to other novel antipseudomonal agents. Clinical resistance was documented in 9 isolates from 6 patients. Resistance genes associated with a statistically significant increase in cefiderocol MICs included ampC, pmrAB, galU, fusA1 and those coding the penicillin-binding proteins PBP2 and PBP3. Likewise, mutations within several genes participating in different iron-uptake systems were found to be significantly associated with resistance, including genes participating in the pyochelin and pyoverdin biosynthesis and several tonB-dependent receptors. Mutator and small colony variants isolates were also associated with increased cefiderocol MICs. Cefiderocol resistance is modulated by a complex mutational resistome, potentially conferring cross-resistance to novel beta-lactam beta-lactamase combinations, as well as an extended list of mutated iron-uptake genes. Monitoring the acquisition of mutations in all these genes will be helpful to guide treatments and mitigate the emergence and spread of resistance to this novel antibiotic.;2023;Apr;Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases;"López-Causapé C; Maruri-Aransolo A; Gomis-Font MA; Penev I; Castillo MG; Mulet X; de Dios Caballero J; Campo RD; Cantón R; Oliver A";"López-Causapé C; Maruri-Aransolo A; Gomis-Font MA; Penev I; Castillo MG; Mulet X; de Dios Caballero J; Campo RD; Cantón R; Oliver A.

10.1016/j.cmi.2023.12.026;Pseudomonasaeruginosa antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, resistance mechanisms and international clonal lineages: update from ESGARS-ESCMID/ISARPAE Group.;Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen considered one of the paradigms of antimicrobial resistance, is among the main causes of hospital-acquired and chronic infections associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This growing threat results from the extraordinary capacity of P. aeruginosa to develop antimicrobial resistance through chromosomal mutations, the increasing prevalence of transferable resistance determinants (such as the carbapenemases and the extended-spectrum β-lactamases), and the global expansion of epidemic lineages. The general objective of this initiative is to provide a comprehensive update of P. aeruginosa resistance mechanisms, especially for the extensively drug-resistant (XDR)/difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR) international high-risk epidemic lineages, and how the recently approved β-lactams and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations may affect resistance mechanisms and the definition of susceptibility profiles. To address this challenge, the European Study Group for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (ESGARS) from the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases launched the 'Improving Surveillance of Antibiotic-Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Europe (ISARPAE)' initiative in 2022, supported by the Joint programming initiative on antimicrobial resistance network call and included a panel of over 40 researchers from 18 European Countries. Thus, a ESGARS-ISARPAE position paper was designed and the final version agreed after four rounds of revision and discussion by all panel members. To provide an update on (a) the emerging resistance mechanisms to classical and novel anti-pseudomonal agents, with a particular focus on β-lactams, (b) the susceptibility profiles associated with the most relevant β-lactam resistance mechanisms, (c) the impact of the novel agents and resistance mechanisms on the definitions of resistance profiles, and (d) the globally expanding XDR/DTR high-risk lineages and their association with transferable resistance mechanisms.

10.1016/j.cmi.2024.06.026;The effects of single and multiple resistance mechanisms on bacterial response to meropenem.;"Meropenem is commonly used against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Traditionally, the time unbound antibiotic concentration exceeds the MIC (fT>MIC) is used to select carbapenem regimens. We aimed to characterize the effects of different baseline resistance mechanisms on bacterial killing and resistance emergence; evaluate whether fT>MIC can predict these effects; and, develop a novel Quantitative and Systems Pharmacology (QSP) model to describe the effects of baseline resistance mechanisms on the time-course of bacterial response. Seven isogenic P. aeruginosa strains with a range of resistance mechanisms and MICs were used in 10-day hollow-fiber infection model studies. Meropenem pharmacokinetic profiles were simulated for various regimens (t1/2,meropenem = 1.5 h). All viable counts on drug-free, 3 × MIC, and 5 × MIC meropenem-containing agar across all strains, five regimens, and control (n = 90 profiles) were simultaneously subjected to QSP modeling. Whole genome sequencing was completed for total population samples and emergent resistant colonies at 239 h. Regimens achieving ≥98%fT>1×MIC suppressed resistance emergence of the mexR knockout strain. Even 100%fT>5 × MIC failed to achieve this against the strain with OprD loss and the ampD and mexR double-knockout strain. Baseline resistance mechanisms affected bacterial outcomes, even for strains with the same MIC. Genomic analysis revealed that pre-existing resistant subpopulations drove resistance emergence. During meropenem exposure, mutations in mexR were selected in strains with baseline oprD mutations, and vice versa, confirming these as major mechanisms of resistance emergence. Secondary mutations occurred in lysS or argS, coding for lysyl and arginyl tRNA synthetases, respectively. The QSP model well-characterized all bacterial outcomes of the seven strains simultaneously, which fT>MIC could not.";2024;Oct;Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases;"Fuhs DT; Cortés-Lara S; Tait JR; Rogers KE; López-Causapé C; Lee WL; Shackleford DM; Nation RL; Oliver A; Landersdorfer CB";"Fuhs DT; Cortés-Lara S; Tait JR; Rogers KE; López-Causapé C; Lee WL; Shackleford DM; Nation RL; Oliver A; Landersdorfer CB.

10.1016/j.ebiom.2024.105367;Monitoring of Pseudomonas aeruginosa mutational resistome dynamics using an enrichment panel for direct sequencing of clinical samples.;Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major cause of hospital-acquired and chronic infections, characterised by an extraordinary capacity to develop antimicrobial resistance through the selection of chromosomal mutations, leading to treatment failure. Here, we designed and tested a hybridisation-based capture system for the enrichment of genes of interest before sequencing to monitor resistant populations genomics directly from clinical samples. A panel for enrichment before sequencing of close to 200 genes related to P. aeruginosa antimicrobial resistance, multilocus sequence typing, mutability or virulence was designed, synthesised (KAPA HyperCap, Roche) and initially validated in vitro using a multidrug-resistant ST175 isolate and representative isolates from major P. aeruginosa clades. In vivo testing included ventilator associated pneumonia by MDR P. aeruginosa in ICU (3-10 sequential samples from 3 patients) and chronic respiratory infection by hypermutable P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis (8 sequential samples from a single patient covering a 4-year period). Results from direct sequencing with the enrichment panel were compared with those of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and phenotypic profiling of 10 isolated colonies per sample. In vitro assays confirmed the selectivity of the enrichment panel and the correct identification of the vast mutational resistome of ST175, including specific mutations even when introduced in a 1:100 proportion. In vivo performance was at least equivalent to sequencing 10 colonies per sample, including the accurate identification of the sequence types and the basal and acquired mutational resistome. To note, specific resistance mutations, such as those in ampC leading to resistance to novel β-lactams, could be traced even at frequencies of 1%. Moreover, the coselection of mutator populations and antibiotic resistance mutations, predicted in theoretical and in vitro studies, was evidenced in vivo. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that resistance genomics of P. aeruginosa can be analysed directly from clinical samples, determining not only a considerable reduction in turnaround time and cost from a diagnostics perspective, but also an unprecedented potency for accurate monitoring of in vivo population dynamics in bacterial infections.

Carbapenem-resistant bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are the most important in clinical practice. The objective of these guidelines is to update the recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of infections caused by these multidrug resistant bacteria.

This is particularly important in patients undergoing extracorporeal life support techniques such as renal replacement therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. These techniques can introduce additional pharmacokinetic alterations, potentially leading to suboptimal exposure to antibiotics. This study aims to outline dosing strategies and therapeutic drug monitoring protocols for new β-lactam antibiotics effective against MDR-GNB in critically ill patients undergoing extracorporeal life support techniques at a national level. Additionally, the study seeks to develop a consensus document, based on available evidence. The project will comprise two main phases: I) A national survey, and II) the development of a consensus document. This consensus document, undertaken according to ACCORD guidelines, will encompass: a) establishment of a multidisciplinary panel of experts, b) prospective registration of the consensus, c) evidence synthesis, d) modified Delphi rounds. The antimicrobials to be included will be: meropenem, ceftazidime/avibactam, ceftolozane/tazobactam, cefiderocol, meropenem/vaborbactam, imipenem/relebactam, and aztreonam. Extracorporeal life support techniques will include continuous renal replacement therapy, conventional intermittent hemodialysis, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The availability of extracorporeal life support techniques has expanded significantly in recent years, alongside a rise in the prevalence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB).

The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of BIC/FTC/TAF compared to other first-line antiretroviral regimens in treatment-naïve adult individuals from the CoRIS Cohort starting ART with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3 and/or AIDS-defining conditions between January 1st 2019 and November 30th 2020. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) of association between initial regimen and achievement of viral suppression (VS) (primary objective), defined as HIV RNA <50 cop/mL, and immunological recovery (IR) (secondary objective), defined as CD4 count >200 cells/mm3, at weeks 24 and 48 after initiation of ART. We evaluated 314 individuals (84.7% men, median age 40 years). Of them, 158 initiated with BIC/FTC/TAF. At inclusion, 117 had an AIDS-defining condition.

We constructed 82 E. coli laboratory transformants expressing the main β-lactamases circulating in Enterobacterales (70 expressing single β-lactamase and 12 producing double carbapenemase) under high (E. coli TG1) and low (E. coli HB4) permeability conditions. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was determined by reference broth microdilution. Aztreonam/avibactam, cefepime/zidebactam, cefiderocol, meropenem/xeruborbactam and meropenem/nacubactam were active against all E. coli TG1 transformants. Imipenem/relebactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, cefepime/taniborbactam and cefepime/enmetazobactam were also highly active, but unstable against most of MBL-producing transformants. Combination of β-lactamases with porin deficiency (E. coli HB4) did not significantly affect the activity of aztreonam/avibactam, cefepime/zidebactam, cefiderocol or meropenem/nacubactam, but limited the effectiveness of the rest of carbapenem- and cefepime-based combinations. Double-carbapenemase production resulted in the loss of activity of most of the compounds tested, an effect particularly evident for those E. coli HB4 transformants in which MBLs were present. Our findings highlight the promising activity that cefiderocol and new β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors have against recombinant E. coli strains expressing widespread β-lactamases, including when these are combined with low permeability or other enzymes. Aztreonam/avibactam, cefiderocol, cefepime/zidebactam and meropenem/nacubactam will help to mitigate to some extent the urgency of new compounds able to resist MBL action, although NDM enzymes represent a growing challenge against which drug development efforts are still needed.;2024;May;International journal of antimicrobial agents;"Blanco-Martín T; Alonso-García I; González-Pinto L; Outeda-García M; Guijarro-Sánchez P; López-Hernández I; Pérez-Vázquez M; Aracil B; López-Cerero L; Fraile-Ribot P; Oliver A; Vázquez-Ucha JC; Beceiro A; Bou G; Arca-Suárez J";"Blanco-Martín T; Alonso-García I; González-Pinto L; Outeda-García M; Guijarro-Sánchez P; López-Hernández I; Pérez-Vázquez M; Aracil B; López-Cerero L; Fraile-Ribot P; Oliver A; Vázquez-Ucha JC; Beceiro A; Bou G; Arca-Suárez J.

10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2024.107161;Synergistic effects of inhaled aztreonam plus tobramycin on hypermutable cystic fibrosis Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates in a dynamic biofilm model evaluated by mechanism-based modelling and whole genome sequencing.;Hypermutable Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains are highly prevalent in chronic lung infections of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Acute exacerbations of these infections have limited treatment options. This study aimed to investigate inhaled aztreonam and tobramycin against clinical hypermutable P. aeruginosa strains using the CDC dynamic in vitro biofilm reactor (CBR), mechanism-based mathematical modelling (MBM) and genomic studies. Two CF multidrug-resistant strains were investigated in a 168 h CBR (n = 2 biological replicates). Regimens were inhaled aztreonam (75 mg 8-hourly) and tobramycin (300 mg 12-hourly) in monotherapies and combination. The simulated pharmacokinetic profiles of aztreonam and tobramycin (t1/2 = 3 h) were based on published lung fluid concentrations in patients with CF. Total viable and resistant counts were determined for planktonic and biofilm bacteria. MBM of total and resistant bacterial counts and whole genome sequencing were completed. Both isolates showed reproducible bacterial regrowth and resistance amplification for the monotherapies by 168 h. The combination performed synergistically, with minimal resistant subpopulations compared to the respective monotherapies at 168 h. Mechanistic synergy appropriately described the antibacterial effects of the combination regimen in the MBM.

To evaluate risk factors associated with multidrug-resistant (MDR) infection and its clinical impact in a cohort of patients with healthcare-associated bacteraemic urinary tract infections (BUTIs). This was a prospective, multicentre, post-hoc analysis of patients with healthcare-associated-BUTI (ITUBRAS-2). The primary outcome was MDR profile. Secondary outcomes were clinical response (at 48-72 h and at hospital discharge) and length of hospital stay from onset of BUTI. Logistic regression was used to evaluate variables associated with MDR profile and clinical response. Length of hospital stay was evaluated using multivariate median regression. In all, 443 episodes were included, of which 271 (61.17%) were classified as expressing an MDR profile. In univariate analysis, MDR profile was associated with E. coli episodes (odds ratio (OR): 3.13; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.11-4.69, P < 0.001) and the extensively drug-resistant (XDR) pattern with P. aeruginosa aetiology (7.84; 2.37-25.95; P = 0.001). MDR was independently associated with prior use of fluoroquinolones (adjusted OR: 2.43; 95% CI: 1.25-4.69), cephalosporins (2.14; 1.35-3.41), and imipenem or meropenem (2.08; 1.03-4.20) but not with prior ertapenem. In terms of outcomes, MDR profile was not associated with lower frequency of clinical cure, but was associated with longer hospital stay.

10.1016/j.lanepe.2023.100736;Pseudomonas aeruginosa antibiotic susceptibility profiles, genomic epidemiology and resistance mechanisms: a nation-wide five-year time lapse analysis.;Pseudomonas aeruginosa healthcare-associated infections are one of the top antimicrobial resistance threats world-wide. In order to analyze the current trends, we performed a Spanish nation-wide high-resolution analysis of the susceptibility profiles, the genomic epidemiology and the resistome of P. aeruginosa over a five-year time lapse. A total of 3.180 nonduplicated P. aeruginosa clinical isolates from two Spanish nation-wide surveys performed in October 2017 and 2022 were analyzed. MICs of 13 antipseudomonals were determined by ISO-EUCAST. Multidrug resistance (MDR)/extensively drug resistance (XDR)/difficult to treat resistance (DTR)/pandrug resistance (PDR) profiles were defined following established criteria. All XDR/DTR isolates were subjected to whole genome sequencing (WGS). A decrease in resistance to all tested antibiotics, including older and newer antimicrobials, was observed in 2022 vs 2017. Likewise, a major reduction of XDR (15.2% vs 5.9%) and DTR (4.2 vs 2.1%) profiles was evidenced, and even more patent among ICU isolates [XDR (26.0% vs 6.0%) and DTR (8.9% vs 2.6%)] (p < 0.001). The prevalence of Extended-spectrum β-lactamase/carbapenemase production was slightly lower in 2022 (2.1%. vs 3.1%, p = 0.064). However, there was a significant increase in the proportion of carbapenemase production among carbapenem-resistant strains (29.4% vs 18.1%, p = 0.0246). While ST175 was still the most frequent clone among XDR, a slight reduction in its prevalence was noted (35.9% vs 45.5%, p = 0.106) as opposed to ST235 which increased significantly (24.3% vs 12.3%, p = 0.0062). While the generalized decrease in P. aeruginosa resistance, linked to a major reduction in the prevalence of XDR strains, is encouraging, the negative counterpart is the increase in the proportion of XDR strains producing carbapenemases, associated to the significant advance of the concerning world-wide disseminated hypervirulent high-risk clone ST235. Continued high-resolution surveillance, integrating phenotypic and genomic data, is necessary for understanding resistance trends and analyzing the impact of national plans on antimicrobial resistance.

10.1016/j.snb.2022.132638;Plasma-induced nanoparticle aggregation for stratifying COVID-19 patients according to disease severity.;Stratifying patients according to disease severity has been a major hurdle during the COVID-19 pandemic. This usually requires evaluating the levels of several biomarkers, which may be cumbersome when rapid decisions are required. In this manuscript we show that a single nanoparticle aggregation test can be used to distinguish patients that require intensive care from those that have already been discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU). It consists of diluting a platelet-free plasma sample and then adding gold nanoparticles. The nanoparticles aggregate to a larger extent when the samples are obtained from a patient in the ICU. This changes the color of the colloidal suspension, which can be evaluated by measuring the pixel intensity of a photograph. Although the exact factor or combination of factors behind the different aggregation behavior is unknown, control experiments demonstrate that the presence of proteins in the samples is crucial for the test to work. Principal component analysis demonstrates that the test result is highly correlated to biomarkers of prognosis and inflammation that are commonly used to evaluate the severity of COVID-19 patients. The results shown here pave the way to develop nanoparticle aggregation assays that classify COVID-19 patients according to disease severity, which could be useful to de-escalate care safely and make a better use of hospital resources.;2022;Dec;Sensors and actuators.

10.1017/ice.2023.75;Molecular characterization of a suspected IMP-type carbapenemase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa outbreak reveals two simultaneous outbreaks in a tertiary-care hospital.;To describe IMP-type carbapenemase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa outbreaks at Galdakao University Hospital between March 2021 to December 2021. Outbreak report. Galdakao University Hospital is a tertiary-care hospital in the Basque Country (northern Spain). All patients with a positive IMP-type carbapenemase producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (IMP-PA) culture were included in this study, both colonization and infection cases. An outbreak investigation was conducted, in which molecular epidemiology analysis [pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and whole-genome sequencing (WGS)] and environmental screenings were performed. Between March and December 2021, 21 cases of IMP-PA were detected in Galdakao University Hospital: 18 infection cases and 3 colonization cases. In total, 4 different pulsotypes were detected belonging to 4 clones according to WGS: ST175 (n = 14), ST633 (n = 3), ST179 (n = 3), and ST348 (n = 1). IMP-13 was detected in most isolates belonging to the ST175 clone and in all ST179 and ST348 clones, whereas IMP-29 was detected in isolates belonging to the ST633 clone. Clinical isolates belonging to the ST175 clone were isolated mainly from patients admitted to the respiratory ward, and isolates belonging to the ST633 clone from patients admitted to the ICU. Two environmental isolates belonging to the ST175 clone were detected in the respiratory ward.

10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01724;Rapid Identification and Classification of Pathogens That Produce Carbapenemases and Cephalosporinases with a Colorimetric Paper-Based Multisensor.;Infections caused by bacteria that produce β-lactamases (BLs) are a major problem in hospital settings. The phenotypic detection of these bacterial strains requires culturing samples prior to analysis. This procedure may take up to 72 h, and therefore it cannot be used to guide the administration of the first antibiotic regimen. Here, we propose a multisensor for identifying pathogens bearing different types of β-lactamases above the infectious dose threshold within 90 min that does not require culturing samples. Instead, bacterial cells are preconcentrated in the cellulose scaffold of a paper-based multisensor. Then, 12 assays are performed in parallel to identify whether the pathogens produce carbapenemases and/or cephalosporinases, including metallo-β-lactamases, extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), and AmpC enzymes. The multisensor generates an array of colored spots that can be quantified with image processing software and whose interpretation leads to the detection of the different enzymes depending on their specificity toward the hydrolysis of certain antibiotics, and/or their pattern of inhibition or cofactor activation. The test was validated for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections. The inexpensive paper platform along with the uncomplicated colorimetric readout makes the proposed prototypes promising for developing fully automated platforms for streamlined clinical diagnosis.;2022;Jul;Analytical chemistry;"Santopolo G; Clemente A; Rojo-Molinero E; Oliver A; Noé C; de la Rica R";"Santopolo G; Clemente A; Rojo-Molinero E; Oliver A; Noé C; de la Rica R.

10.1021/acsnano.3c08041;Nonlethal Molecular Nanomachines Potentiate Antibiotic Activity Against Gram-Negative Bacteria by Increasing Cell Permeability and Attenuating Efflux.;Antibiotic resistance is a pressing public health threat. Despite rising resistance, antibiotic development, especially for Gram-negative bacteria, has stagnated. As the traditional antibiotic research and development pipeline struggles to address this growing concern, alternative solutions become imperative. Synthetic molecular nanomachines (MNMs) are molecular structures that rotate unidirectionally in a controlled manner in response to a stimulus, such as light, resulting in a mechanical action that can propel molecules to drill into cell membranes, causing rapid cell death. Due to their broad destructive capabilities, clinical translation of MNMs remains challenging. Hence, here, we explore the ability of nonlethal visible-light-activated MNMs to potentiate conventional antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria. Nonlethal MNMs enhanced the antibacterial activity of various classes of conventional antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, including those typically effective only against Gram-positive strains, reducing the antibiotic concentration required for bactericidal action. Our study also revealed that MNMs bind to the negatively charged phospholipids of the bacterial inner membrane, leading to permeabilization of the cell envelope and impairment of efflux pump activity following light activation of MNMs. The combined effects of MNMs on membrane permeability and efflux pumps resulted in increased antibiotic accumulation inside the cell, reversing antibiotic resistance and attenuating its development. These results identify nonlethal MNMs as pleiotropic antibiotic enhancers or adjuvants. The combination of MNMs with traditional antibiotics is a promising strategy against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections. This approach can reduce the amount of antibiotics needed and slow down antibiotic resistance development, thereby preserving the effectiveness of our current antibiotics.;2024;Jan;ACS nano;"Santos AL; Liu D; van Venrooy A; Beckham JL; Oliver A; Tegos GP; Tour JM";"Santos AL; Liu D; van Venrooy A; Beckham JL; Oliver A; Tegos GP; Tour JM.

The device incorporates an on-chip electrochemical cell array and a multichannel paper component, engineered to be easily aligned into a polymeric cartridge and exchanged if necessary. Calibration curves at clinically relevant biomarker concentration ranges are produced in buffer and artificial sputum.

The present study including knockout mutants, β-lactamase cloning, gene expression analysis, characterization of resistance phenotypes, and the Galleria mellonella infection model fills these gaps demonstrating that: (i) AmpC enzyme does not show any collateral activity impacting fitness/virulence; (ii) AmpC hyperproduction mediated by ampD inactivation does not entail any biological cost; (iii) alteration of peptidoglycan recycling alone or combined with AmpC hyperproduction causes no attenuation of E. cloacae virulence in contrast to other species; (iv) derepression of E. cloacae AmpC does not follow a stepwise dynamics linked to the sequential inactivation of AmpD amidase homologues as happens in Pseudomonas aeruginosa; (v) the enigmatic additional putative AmpC-type β-lactamase generally present in E. cloacae does not contribute to the classical cephalosporinase hyperproduction-based resistance, having a negligible impact on phenotypes even when hyperproduced from multicopy vector.

Existing data support the combination of aztreonam and ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA) against class serine-β-lactamase (SBL)- and metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) - producing Enterobacterales. However, data about that combination against SBL- and MBL-producing P. aeruginosa are scarce. The objective of the study was to assess the in vitro activity of CZA and aztreonam alone and in combination against SBL- and MBL-producing XDR P. aeruginosa isolates. The combination was analyzed by means of the hollow-fiber infection model in three selected carbapenemase-producing P. aeruginosa isolates that were representative of the three most common XDRP. aeruginosa high-risk clones (ST175, ST111, ST235) responsible for global nosocomial infection outbreaks. The three isolates were nonsusceptible to CZA and nonsusceptible to aztreonam. In the dynamic hollow-fiber infection model, the combination of CZA plus aztreonam exerts a bactericidal effect on the isolates, regardless of their resistance mechanism and demonstrates synergistic interactions against three isolates, achieving a bacterial reduction of 5.07 log10 CFU/ml, 5.2 log10 CFU/ml and 4 log10 CFU/ml, respectively. The combination of CZA and aztreonam significantly enhanced the in vitro efficacy against XDR P. aeruginosa isolates compared to each monotherapy. This improvement suggests that the combination could serve as a feasible treatment alternative for infections caused by carbapenemase-producing XDR P. aeruginosa, especially in scenarios where no other treatment options are available.;2025;Jan;Infectious diseases (London, England);"Montero MM; Domene-Ochoa S; Prim N; Ferola E; López-Causapé C; Echeverria D; Morisaki MFA; Vega-Toribio V; Sorlí L; Luque S; Padilla E; Oliver A; Horcajada JP";"Montero MM; Domene-Ochoa S; Prim N; Ferola E; López-Causapé C; Echeverria D; Morisaki MFA; Vega-Toribio V; Sorlí L; Luque S; Padilla E; Oliver A; Horcajada JP.

In June 2018, we collected information on when generic antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) were introduced in the different hospitals, how the decisions to use them were made, and how the information was provided to the patients. Most of the nine available generic ARVs in Spain by June 2018 had been introduced in at least 85% of the participating hospitals, except for zidovudine (AZT)/lamivudine (3TC) and AZT. The time difference between the effective marketing date of each generic ARV and its first dispensing date in the hospitals was much shorter for the more recently approved generic ARV since the year 2017. However, only up to 20% of the hospitals de-simplified efavirenz (EFV)/tenofovir disoproxil (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC), dolutegravir (DTG)/abacavir (ABC)/3TC, and rilpivirine (RPV)/TDF/FTC (to generic EFV+TDF/FTC, DTG+generic ABC/3TC, and RPV+generic TDF/FTC, respectively), whereas the generic STR EFV/TDF/FTC was introduced in 87.8% of the centers. The median times between the date of effective marketing of generic TDF/FTC and the date of de-simplification of EFV/TDF/FTC and RPV/TDF/FTC were 723 [interquartile range (IQR): 369-1,119] and 234 (IQR: 142-264) days, respectively; this time was 155 (IQR: 28-287) days for de-simplification of DTG/ABC/3TC.

10.1093/evlett/qrae030;Antibiotic resistance alters the ability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to invade bacteria from the respiratory microbiome.;The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens is a global health threat. One important unanswered question is how antibiotic resistance influences the ability of a pathogen to invade the host-associated microbiome. Here we investigate how antibiotic resistance impacts the ability of a bacterial pathogen to invade bacteria from the microbiome, using the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the respiratory microbiome as our model system. We measure the ability of P. aeruginosa spontaneous antibiotic-resistant mutants to invade pre-established cultures of commensal respiratory microbes in an assay that allows us to link specific resistance mutations with changes in invasion ability. While commensal respiratory microbes tend to provide some degree of resistance to P. aeruginosa invasion, antibiotic resistance is a double-edged sword that can either help or hinder the ability of P. aeruginosa to invade. The directionality of this help or hindrance depends on both P. aeruginosa genotype and respiratory microbe identity. Specific resistance mutations in genes involved in multidrug efflux pump regulation are shown to facilitate the invasion of P. aeruginosa into Staphylococcus lugdunensis, yet impair invasion into Rothia mucilaginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Streptococcus species provide the strongest resistance to P. aeruginosa invasion, and this is maintained regardless of antibiotic resistance genotype. Our study demonstrates how the cost of mutations that provide enhanced antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa can crucially depend on community context. We suggest that attempts to manipulate the microbiome should focus on promoting the growth of commensals that can increase the fitness costs associated with antibiotic resistance and provide robust inhibition of both wildtype and antibiotic-resistant pathogen strains.;2024;Sep;Evolution letters;"Lindon S; Shah S; Gifford DR; Lood C; Gomis Font MA; Kaur D; Oliver A; MacLean RC; Wheatley RM";"Lindon S; Shah S; Gifford DR; Lood C; Gomis Font MA; Kaur D; Oliver A; MacLean RC; Wheatley RM.

10.1093/femsre/fuad010;Bacterial virulence regulation through soluble peptidoglycan fragments sensing and response: knowledge gaps and therapeutic potential.;Given the growing clinical-epidemiological threat posed by the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance, new therapeutic options are urgently needed, especially against top nosocomial pathogens such as those within the ESKAPE group. In this scenario, research is pushed to explore therapeutic alternatives and, among these, those oriented toward reducing bacterial pathogenic power could pose encouraging options. However, the first step in developing these antivirulence weapons is to find weak points in the bacterial biology to be attacked with the goal of dampening pathogenesis. In this regard, during the last decades some studies have directly/indirectly suggested that certain soluble peptidoglycan-derived fragments display virulence-regulatory capacities, likely through similar mechanisms to those followed to regulate the production of several β-lactamases: binding to specific transcriptional regulators and/or sensing/activation of two-component systems. These data suggest the existence of intra- and also intercellular peptidoglycan-derived signaling capable of impacting bacterial behavior, and hence likely exploitable from the therapeutic perspective. Using the well-known phenomenon of peptidoglycan metabolism-linked β-lactamase regulation as a starting point, we gather and integrate the studies connecting soluble peptidoglycan sensing with fitness/virulence regulation in Gram-negatives, dissecting the gaps in current knowledge that need filling to enable potential therapeutic strategy development, a topic which is also finally discussed.;2023;Mar;FEMS microbiology reviews;"Escobar-Salom M; Barceló IM; Jordana-Lluch E; Torrens G; Oliver A; Juan C";"Escobar-Salom M; Barceló IM; Jordana-Lluch E; Torrens G; Oliver A; Juan C.

10.1093/jac/dkab496;Comparative analysis of in vitro dynamics and mechanisms of ceftolozane/tazobactam and imipenem/relebactam resistance development in Pseudomonas aeruginosa XDR high-risk clones.;To analyse the dynamics and mechanisms of stepwise resistance development to ceftolozane/tazobactam and imipenem/relebactam in XDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical strains. XDR clinical isolates belonging to ST111 (main resistance mechanisms: oprD-, dacB-, CARB-2), ST175 (oprD-, ampR-G154R) and ST235 (oprD-, OXA-2) high-risk clones were incubated for 24 h in Müeller-Hinton Broth with 0.125-64 mg/L of ceftolozane + tazobactam 4 mg/L or imipenem + relebactam 4 mg/L. Tubes from the highest antibiotic concentration showing growth were reinoculated into fresh medium containing concentrations up to 64 mg/L for 7 consecutive days. Two colonies per strain from each of the triplicate experiments were characterized by determining the susceptibility profiles, whole genome sequencing (WGS), and in vitro fitness through competitive growth assays. Resistance development occurred more slowly and reached a lower level for imipenem/relebactam than for ceftolozane/tazobactam in all tested XDR strains. Moreover, resistance development to imipenem/relebactam remained low even for ST175 isolates that had developed ceftolozane/tazobactam resistance during therapy. Lineages evolved in the presence of ceftolozane/tazobactam showed high-level resistance, imipenem/relebactam hypersusceptibility and low fitness cost, whereas lineages evolved in the presence of imipenem/relebactam showed moderate (borderline) resistance, no cross-resistance to ceftolozane/tazobactam and high fitness cost. WGS evidenced that ceftolozane/tazobactam resistance was mainly caused by mutations in the catalytic centres of intrinsic (AmpC) or acquired (OXA) β-lactamases, whereas lineages evolved in imipenem/relebactam frequently showed structural mutations in MexB or in ParS, along with some strain-specific mutations. Imipenem/relebactam could be a useful alternative for the treatment of XDR P. aeruginosa infections, potentially reducing resistance development during therapy.;2022;Mar;The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy;"Gomis-Font MA; Cabot G; López-Argüello S; Zamorano L; Juan C; Moyá B; Oliver A";"Gomis-Font MA; Cabot G; López-Argüello S; Zamorano L; Juan C; Moyá B; Oliver A.

10.1093/jac/dkac122;Susceptibility profiles and resistance genomics of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from European ICUs participating in the ASPIRE-ICU trial.;To determine the susceptibility profiles and the resistome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from European ICUs during a prospective cohort study (ASPIRE-ICU). 723 isolates from respiratory samples or perianal swabs of 402 patients from 29 sites in 11 countries were studied. MICs of 12 antibiotics were determined by broth microdilution. Horizontally acquired β-lactamases were analysed through phenotypic and genetic assays. The first respiratory isolates from 105 patients providing such samples were analysed through WGS, including the analysis of the resistome and a previously defined genotypic resistance score. Spontaneous mutant frequencies and the genetic basis of hypermutation were assessed. All agents except colistin showed resistance rates above 20%, including ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam. 24.9% of the isolates were XDR, with a wide intercountry variation (0%-62.5%). 13.2% of the isolates were classified as DTR (difficult-to-treat resistance). 21.4% of the isolates produced ESBLs (mostly PER-1) or carbapenemases (mostly NDM-1, VIM-1/2 and GES-5). WGS showed that these determinants were linked to high-risk clones (particularly ST235 and ST654). WGS revealed a wide repertoire of mutation-driven resistance mechanisms, with multiple lineage-specific mutations. The most frequently mutated genes were gyrA, parC, oprD, mexZ, nalD and parS, but only two of the isolates were hypermutable. Finally, a good accuracy of the genotypic score to predict susceptibility (91%-100%) and resistance (94%-100%) was documented. An overall high prevalence of resistance is documented European ICUs, but with a wide intercountry variability determined by the dissemination of XDR high-risk clones, arguing for the need to reinforce infection control measures.;2022;Jun;The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy;"Torrens G; van der Schalk TE; Cortes-Lara S; Timbermont L; Del Barrio-Tofiño E; Xavier BB; Zamorano L; Lammens C; Ali O; Ruzin A; Goossens H; Kumar-Singh S; Kluytmans J; Paling F; MacLean RC; Köhler T; López-Causapé C; Malhotra-Kumar S; Oliver A";"Torrens G; van der Schalk TE; Cortes-Lara S; Timbermont L; Del Barrio-Tofiño E; Xavier BB; Zamorano L; Lammens C; Ali O; Ruzin A; Goossens H; Kumar-Singh S; Kluytmans J; Paling F; MacLean RC; Köhler T; López-Causapé C; Malhotra-Kumar S; Oliver A.

10.1093/jac/dkac232;In vivo translational assessment of the GES genotype on the killing profile of ceftazidime, ceftazidime/avibactam and meropenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.;"To evaluate the in vivo killing profile of human-simulated exposures of ceftazidime, ceftazidime/avibactam and meropenem against GES-harbouring Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the murine thigh infection model. Five P. aeruginosa isolates [three isogenic (GES-1, GES-5 and GES-15) and two clinical (GES-5 and GES-15)] were evaluated. MICs were determined using broth microdilution. Human-simulated regimens (HSRs) of ceftazidime 2 g IV q8h as a 2 h infusion, ceftazidime/avibactam 2.5 g IV q8h as a 2 h infusion and meropenem 2 g IV q8h as a 3 h infusion were administered. Change in bacterial burden relative to baseline was assessed. Modal MICs ranged from 8 to &gt;64 mg/L for ceftazidime, from 1 to 16 mg/L for ceftazidime/avibactam and from 1 to &gt;64 mg/L for meropenem. In vivo, for the isogenic strains, avibactam augmented ceftazidime activity against the GES-1- and GES-15-harbouring isolates. Both ceftazidime and ceftazidime/avibactam resulted in significant kill against the GES-5 isogenic isolate. The meropenem HSR produced &gt;1 log10 kill against each isogenic isolate (MICs of 1-4 mg/L). Against the GES-5 clinical isolate, ceftazidime and ceftazidime/avibactam resulted in &gt;1 log10 kill compared with bacterial growth with the meropenem HSR. In the clinical isolate harbouring GES-15, the elevated MICs of ceftazidime and ceftazidime/avibactam reduced the effectiveness of both compounds, while the observed reduction in meropenem MIC translated into in vivo efficacy of the HSR regimen, predictive of clinical efficacy. In GES-harbouring P. aeruginosa, quantitative reductions in bacterial density observed with the translational murine model suggest that the phenotypic profile of ceftazidime, ceftazidime/avibactam and meropenem is predictive of clinical efficacy when using the evaluated dosing regimens.";2022;Sep;The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy;"Gill CM; Oliver A; Fraile-Ribot PA; Nicolau DP";"Gill CM; Oliver A; Fraile-Ribot PA; Nicolau DP.

The activity of cefiderocol, imipenem/relebactam, cefepime/taniborbactam, cefepime/zidebactam and comparators was evaluated against a collection of 30 molecularly characterized ceftolozane/tazobactam- and/or ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates from patients previously treated with cephalosporins. To evaluate how the different β-lactamases in the clinical isolates affected the resistance to these agents, a copy of each blaPDC, blaOXA-2 and blaOXA-10 ancestral and mutant allele from the clinical isolates was cloned in pUCp24 and expressed in dual blaPDC-oprD (for blaPDC-like genes) or single oprD (for blaOXA-2-like and blaOXA-10-like genes) PAO1 knockout mutants. MICs were determined using reference methodologies. For all isolates, MICs were higher than 4 and/or 8 mg/L for ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam, respectively. Cefiderocol was the most active agent, showing activity against all isolates, except one clinical isolate that carried an R504C substitution in PBP3 (MIC = 16 mg/L). Imipenem/relebactam was highly active against all isolates, except two clinical isolates that carried the VIM-20 carbapenemase. Cefepime/zidebactam and cefepime/taniborbactam displayed activity against most of the isolates, but resistance was observed in some strains with PBP3 amino acid substitutions or that overexpressed mexAB-oprM or mexXY efflux pumps. Evaluation of transformants revealed that OXA-2 and OXA-10 extended-spectrum variants cause a 2-fold increase in the MIC of cefiderocol relative to parental enzymes. Cefiderocol, imipenem/relebactam, cefepime/taniborbactam and cefepime/zidebactam show promising and complementary in vitro activity against ceftolozane/tazobactam- and ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant P. aeruginosa.

10.1093/jac/dkac298;In vitro activity of imipenem/relebactam against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates recovered from ICU patients in Spain and Portugal (SUPERIOR and STEP studies).;"To study the in vitro activity of imipenem/relebactam and comparators and the imipenem/relebactam resistance mechanisms in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa collection from Portugal (STEP, 2017-18) and Spain (SUPERIOR, 2016-17) surveillance studies. P. aeruginosa isolates (n = 474) were prospectively recovered from complicated urinary tract (cUTI), complicated intra-abdominal (cIAI) and lower respiratory tract (LRTI) infections in 11 Portuguese and 8 Spanish ICUs. MICs were determined (ISO broth microdilution). All imipenem/relebactam-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates (n = 30) and a subset of imipenem/relebactam-susceptible strains (n = 32) were characterized by WGS. Imipenem/relebactam (93.7% susceptible), ceftazidime/avibactam (93.5% susceptible) and ceftolozane/tazobactam (93.2% susceptible) displayed comparable activity. The imipenem/relebactam resistance rate was 6.3% (Portugal 5.8%; Spain 8.9%). Relebactam restored imipenem susceptibility to 76.9% (103/134) of imipenem-resistant isolates, including MDR (82.1%; 32/39), XDR (68.8%; 53/77) and difficult-to-treat (DTR) isolates (67.2%; 45/67). Among sequenced strains, differences in population structure were detected depending on the country: clonal complex (CC)175 and CC309 in Spain and CC235, CC244, CC348 and CC253 in Portugal. Different carbapenemase gene distributions were also found: VIM-20 (n = 3), VIM-1 (n = 2), VIM-2 (n = 1) and VIM-36 (n = 1) in Spain and GES-13 (n = 13), VIM-2 (n = 3) and KPC-3 (n = 2) in Portugal. GES-13-CC235 (n = 13) and VIM type-CC175 (n = 5) associations were predominant in Portugal and Spain, respectively. Imipenem/relebactam showed activity against KPC-3 strains (2/2), but was inactive against all GES-13 producers and most of the VIM producers (8/10). Mutations in genes affecting porin inactivation, efflux pump overexpression and LPS modification might also be involved in imipenem/relebactam resistance.

One baseline (PA1) and two post-exposure (PA2 and PA3) isolates obtained before and during treatment of a nosocomial P. aeruginosa meningoventriculitis were evaluated. MICs were determined by broth microdilution. Mutational changes were investigated through WGS. The impact on β-lactam resistance of mutations in blaPDC and mexR was determined through cloning experiments and complementation assays. Isolate PA1 showed baseline resistance mutations in DacB (I354A) and OprD (N142fs) conferring resistance to conventional antipseudomonals but susceptibility to ceftazidime/avibactam, ceftolozane/tazobactam and imipenem/relebactam. Post-exposure isolates showed two divergent ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant phenotypes associated with distinctive mutations affecting the intrinsic P PDC β-lactamase (S254Ins) (PA2: ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant) or MexAB-OprM negative regulator MexR in combination with modification of PBP3 (PA3: ceftazidime/avibactam and imipenem/relebactam-relebactam-resistant). Cloning experiments demonstrated the role of PDC modification in resistance to ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam. Complementation with a functional copy of the mexR gene in isolate PA3 restored imipenem/relebactam susceptibility. We demonstrated how P. aeruginosa may simultaneously develop resistance and compromise the activity of new β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations when exposed to ceftazidime/avibactam through selection of mutations leading to PDC modification and up-regulation of MexAB-OprM-mediated efflux.;2023;May;The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy;"Alonso-García I; Vázquez-Ucha JC; Lasarte-Monterrubio C; González-Mayo E; Lada-Salvador P; Vela-Fernández R; Aja-Macaya P; Guijarro-Sánchez P; Rumbo-Feal S; Muíño-Andrade M; Fernández-González A; Martínez-Guitián M; Beceiro A; Rodríguez-Iglesias M; Oliver A; Arca-Suárez J; Galán-Sánchez F; Bou G";"Alonso-García I; Vázquez-Ucha JC; Lasarte-Monterrubio C; González-Mayo E; Lada-Salvador P; Vela-Fernández R; Aja-Macaya P; Guijarro-Sánchez P; Rumbo-Feal S; Muíño-Andrade M; Fernández-González A; Martínez-Guitián M; Beceiro A; Rodríguez-Iglesias M; Oliver A; Arca-Suárez J; Galán-Sánchez F; Bou G.

10.1093/jac/dkad172;In vitro dynamics and mechanisms of cefiderocol resistance development in wild-type, mutator and XDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa.;To analyse the dynamics and mechanisms of stepwise resistance development to cefiderocol in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefiderocol resistance evolution was analysed in WT PAO1, PAOMS (mutS mutator derivate) and three XDR clinical isolates belonging to ST111, ST175 and ST235 clones. Strains were incubated in triplicate experiments for 24 h in iron-depleted CAMHB with 0.06-128 mg/L cefiderocol. Tubes from the highest antibiotic concentration showing growth were reinoculated into fresh medium containing concentrations up to 128 mg/L for 7 consecutive days. Two colonies per strain and experiment were characterized by determining the susceptibility profiles and WGS. Evolution of resistance was significantly enhanced in PAOMS, but was variable for the XDR strains, including levels similar to PAOMS (ST235), similar to PAO1 (ST175) or even below PAO1 (ST111). WGS revealed 2-5 mutations for PAO1 lineages and 35-58 for PAOMS. The number of mutations in the XDR clinical strains ranged from 2 to 4 except for one of the ST235 experiments in which a mutL lineage was selected, thus increasing the number of mutations. The most frequently mutated genes were piuC, fptA and pirR, related to iron uptake. Additionally, an L320P AmpC mutation was selected in multiple lineages and cloning confirmed its major impact on cefiderocol (but not ceftolozane/tazobactam or ceftazidime/avibactam) resistance. Mutations in CpxS and PBP3 were also documented.

Clinical characteristics and outcomes associated with ST131 infection were investigated. A total of 222 E. coli blood isolates were prospectively collected from patients with HCA-BUO from 12 tertiary-care hospitals in Spain (2017-19). Antimicrobial susceptibility and ESBL/carbapenemase production were determined. ST131 subtyping was performed. A subset of 115 isolates were selected for WGS to determine population structure, resistome and virulome. Clinical charts were reviewed. ESBL-producing E. coli prevalence was 30.6% (68/222). ST131 represented 29.7% (66/222) of E. coli isolates and accounted for the majority of ESBL producers (46/68, 67.6%). The C2/H30-Rx subclone accounted for most ST131 isolates (44/66) and was associated with CTX-M-15 (37/44) and OXA-1 enzymes (27/44). Cluster C1-M27 was identified in 4/10 isolates belonging to subclade C1/H30-R1 and associated with CTX-M-27. Additionally, ST131 isolates showed a high content of other acquired resistance genes, and clade C/ST131 isolates carried characteristic QRDR mutations. They were categorized as uropathogenic E. coli and had higher aggregate virulence scores. ST131 infection was associated with more complex patients, prior use of cephalosporins and inadequate empirical treatment but was not associated with worse clinical outcomes. ST131 HiRC is the main driver of ESBL-producing E. coli causing HCA-BUO in Spain, mainly associated with the expansion of subclade CTX-M-15-C2/H30-Rx and the emergence of CTX-M-27-C1/H30-R1 (Cluster C1-M27).;2023;Sep;The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy;"Becerra-Aparicio F; Gómez-Zorrilla S; Hernández-García M; Gijón D; Siverio A; Berbel D; Sánchez-Carrillo C; Cercenado E; Rivera A; de Malet A; Xercavins M; Ruiz de Gopegui E; Canoura-Fernández L; Martínez JA; Seral C; Del Pozo JL; Cotarelo M; Díaz-Regañón J; Cantón R; Oliver A; Horcajada JP; Ruiz-Garbajosa P";"Becerra-Aparicio F; Gómez-Zorrilla S; Hernández-García M; Gijón D; Siverio A; Berbel D; Sánchez-Carrillo C; Cercenado E; Rivera A; de Malet A; Xercavins M; Ruiz de Gopegui E; Canoura-Fernández L; Martínez JA; Seral C; Del Pozo JL; Cotarelo M; Díaz-Regañón J; Cantón R; Oliver A; Horcajada JP; Ruiz-Garbajosa P.

We determine the activity of cefiderocol and comparators in a collection of 154 P. aeruginosa isolates recovered from pwCF during three multicentre studies performed in 17 Spanish hospitals in 2013, 2017 and 2021. ISO broth microdilution was performed and MICs were interpreted with CLSI and EUCAST criteria. Mutation frequency and WGS were also performed. Overall, 21.4% were MDR, 20.8% XDR and 1.3% pandrug-resistant (PDR). Up to 17% of the isolates showed a hypermutator phenotype. Cefiderocol demonstrated excellent activity; only 13 isolates (8.4%) were cefiderocol resistant by EUCAST (none using CLSI). A high proportion of the isolates resistant to ceftolozane/tazobactam (71.4%), meropenem/vaborbactam (70.0%), imipenem/relebactam (68.0%) and ceftazidime/avibactam (55.6%) were susceptible to cefiderocol. Nine out of 13 cefiderocol-resistant isolates were hypermutators (P < 0.001). Eighty-three STs were detected, with ST98 being the most frequent. Only one isolate belonging to the ST175 high-risk clone carried blaVIM-2. Exclusive mutations affecting genes involved in membrane permeability, AmpC overexpression (L320P-AmpC) and efflux pump up-regulation were found in cefiderocol-resistant isolates (MIC = 4-8 mg/L).

Cefiderocol and imipenem/relebactam exhibited excellent in vitro activity against all of the mutational resistance mechanisms studied. Aztreonam/avibactam, cefepime/taniborbactam, cefepime/zidebactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, meropenem/nacubactam and meropenem/xeruborbactam proved to be more vulnerable to mutational events, especially to overexpression of efflux operons. The agents exhibiting the widest spectrum of activity against transferable β-lactamases were aztreonam/avibactam and cefepime/zidebactam, followed by cefepime/taniborbactam, cefiderocol, meropenem/xeruborbactam and meropenem/nacubactam. However, some MBLs, particularly NDM enzymes, may affect their activity. Combined production of certain enzymes (e.g. NDM-1) with increased MexAB-OprM-mediated efflux and OprD deficiency results in resistance to almost all agents tested, including last options such as aztreonam/avibactam and cefiderocol. Cefiderocol and new β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations show promising and complementary in vitro activity against mutational and transferable P. aeruginosa β-lactam resistance. However, the combined effects of efflux pumps, OprD deficiency and efficient β-lactamases could still result in the loss of all therapeutic options. Resistance surveillance, judicious use of new agents and continued drug development efforts are encouraged.;2024;Oct;The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy;"González-Pinto L; Alonso-García I; Blanco-Martín T; Camacho-Zamora P; Fraile-Ribot PA; Outeda-García M; Lasarte-Monterrubio C; Guijarro-Sánchez P; Maceiras R; Moya B; Juan C; Vázquez-Ucha JC; Beceiro A; Oliver A; Bou G; Arca-Suárez J";"González-Pinto L; Alonso-García I; Blanco-Martín T; Camacho-Zamora P; Fraile-Ribot PA; Outeda-García M; Lasarte-Monterrubio C; Guijarro-Sánchez P; Maceiras R; Moya B; Juan C; Vázquez-Ucha JC; Beceiro A; Oliver A; Bou G; Arca-Suárez J.

10.1093/jac/dkae326;Impact of transferable β-lactamases and intrinsic AmpC amino acid substitutions on the activity of cefiderocol against wild-type and iron uptake-deficient mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.;We aimed to analyse the interplay between impaired iron uptake and β-lactamases on cefiderocol resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thirty-one transferable β-lactamases and 16 intrinsic P. aeruginosa AmpC (PDC) variants were cloned and expressed in wild-type (PAO1) and iron uptake-deficient (PAO ΔpiuC) P. aeruginosa backgrounds. MICs of cefiderocol and antipseudomonal β-lactams were determined by reference broth microdilution. Relative to PAO1, deletion of piuC caused a specific 16-fold decrease in cefiderocol activity but negligible effects on the activity of other β-lactams. Among transferable β-lactamases, SHV-12, KPC Ω-loop mutants, NDMs and OXA-15 showed cefiderocol MIC values above the clinical breakpoint (2 mg/L) when expressed in PAO1. When expressed in PAO ΔpiuC, these and the transformants harbouring PER-1, VEB-1, KPC-2, KPC-3, VIM-1, CMY-2, OXA-2 and OXA-14 showed increased MIC values from 16 to >256 mg/L. The PDC variants carrying the Ω-loop changes ΔP215-G222 (PDC-577), E219K (PDC-221 and PDC-558) and the H10 helix change L293P (PDC-219) had the greatest impact on cefiderocol resistance, with MICs of 2-4 mg/L in PAO1 and of up to 32-64 mg/L in PAO ΔpiuC. Widespread enzymes such as GES, CTX-M-9, CTX-M-15, VIM-2-like enzymes, IMPs, DHA-1, FOX-4, OXA-10, OXA-48 and the other PDC variants tested had weaker effects on cefiderocol resistance. We add evidence about the effect of the interplay between iron uptake and β-lactamases on the acquisition of cefiderocol resistance in P. aeruginosa. These findings may help to anticipate the emergence of resistance and optimize the use of cefiderocol against P. aeruginosa infections.;2024;Nov;The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy;"González-Pinto L; Blanco-Martín T; Alonso-García I; Rodríguez-Pallares S; Outeda-García M; Gomis-Font MA; Fraile-Ribot PA; Vázquez-Ucha JC; González-Bello C; Beceiro A; Oliver A; Bou G; Arca-Suárez J";"González-Pinto L; Blanco-Martín T; Alonso-García I; Rodríguez-Pallares S; Outeda-García M; Gomis-Font MA; Fraile-Ribot PA; Vázquez-Ucha JC; González-Bello C; Beceiro A; Oliver A; Bou G; Arca-Suárez J.

10.1093/jacamr/dlae160;Genomic characterization of MRSA recovered from people with cystic fibrosis during two Spanish multicentre studies (2013 and 2021).;"Chronic bronchopulmonary infection due to MRSA in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) has been associated with accelerated decline in lung function, increased hospitalizations and increased mortality. We studied microbiological and genomic characteristics of MRSA isolates recovered from pwCF in two Spanish multicentre studies (2013, 2021). Antimicrobial susceptibility was performed. WGS was carried out to determine population structure [MLST, spa-typing, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec)], resistome and virulome. Clinical charts of MRSA-infected and MRSA-non-infected pwCF were also reviewed. MRSA infection prevalence decreased between 2013 (29/341, 8.5%) and 2021 (21/326, 6.4%) (P = 0.378). Differences in lung function were observed between infected and non-infected patients (P < 0.005). A higher prevalence of hospital-acquired (HA) clones was found compared with community-acquired (CA) clones (2013: 67% versus 33%; and 2021: 71% versus 29%). Overall, we noted clustering of isolates based on year of sampling, type of acquisition and clonal complex (CC). HA-MRSA population was dominated by CC5, with ST125-MRSA-IVc-t067 the most prevalent lineage (37%). A higher clonal diversity was detected among CA-MRSA. One Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL)-positive strain (ST8-MRSA-IV) and three strains of porcine origin (two ST398-MRSA-V-t011, one ST398-MRSA-V-t8567) were found. Additionally, acquired resistance genes (n = 24) were detected, including the cfr gene conferring linezolid resistance. A higher gentamicin resistance was found in 2021 (42%) compared with 2013 (7%) (P = 0.046), associated with the aac(6')-aph(2″) gene. Despite a decrease in MRSA prevalence, we showed its potential impact on CF severity and progression.

10.1111/hiv.13265;Predictors of low-level HIV viraemia and virological failure in the era of integrase inhibitors: A Spanish nationwide cohort.;To pinpoint factors associated with low-level viraemia (LLV) and virological failure (VF) in people living with HIV in the era of high-efficacy antiretroviral treatment (ART) and widespread use of integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTIs)-based ART. We included adults aged > 18 years starting their first ART between 2015 and 2018 in the Spanish HIV/AIDS Research Network National Cohort (CoRIS). Low-level viraemia was defined as plasma viral load (pVL) of 50-199 copies/mL at weeks 48 and 72 and VF was defined as pVL ≥ 50 copies/mL at week 48 and pVL ≥ 200 copies/mL at week 72. Multivariable logistic regression models assessed the impact on LLV and VF of baseline CD4 T-cell count, CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio and pVL, initial ART classes, age at ART initiation, time between HIV diagnosis and ART initiation, gender and transmission route. Out of 4186 participants, 3120 (76.0%) started INSTIs, 455 (11.1%) started boosted protease inhibitors (bPIs) and 443 (10.8%) started nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), either of them with two nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Low-level viraemia was met in 2.5% of participants and VF in 4.3%. There were no significant differences throughout the years for both virological outcomes. Baseline HIV-1 RNA > 5 log10 copies/mL was the only consistent predictor of higher risk of LLV [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 9.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0-48.3] and VF (aOR = 5.4, 95% CI: 1.9-15.1), even in participants treated with INSTIs. The rates of LLV and VF were low but remained steady throughout the years.

10.1111/hiv.13726;Should we measure quality of life among people with HIV? A multicentre survey of physicians' opinions in Spain.;"We assessed the opinions of physicians caring for people with HIV (PWH) from the multicentre Spanish CoRIS cohort regarding the assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We designed an online self-administered questionnaire comprising 27 structured questions across four domains: (i) sociodemographic and clinical data; (ii) usefulness of measuring HRQoL; (iii) information, training and resource needed; and (iv) whether and how HRQoL should be measured. Physicians completed the questionnaire between April and June 2023. Of 131 physicians surveyed [53.8% men, median age 52 years (interquartile range: 42-60)], 90.9% and 88.6% agreed that measuring HRQoL is useful for both PWH and medical decision-making, respectively. However, 67.2% needed training on what HRQoL is and how to measure it, 79.4% required information on validated tools, and 80.9% felt that clinical guidelines are needed. Overall, 90.1% of physicians agreed that HRQoL should be measured among PWH. Most physicians (82.8%) supported using specific scales for PWH, with 74.1% recommending annual measurement, 49.1% suggesting that nurses from HIV units conduct the assessments, and 43.1% favouring personal interviews during medical visits. At the time of the survey, 55.3% of physicians did not measure HRQoL in any patients due to time or resource constraints (75.8%). Despite the recognized importance of HRQoL measurement in PWH, Spanish physicians encounter barriers such as time constraints and limited resources. Developing clear guidelines, using tailored scales, and integrating digital tools along with multidisciplinary support could enhance routine HRQoL assessments and improve patient-centred care.";2025;Feb;HIV medicine;"Izquierdo R; Suárez-García I; Gómez-García T; Marco-Sánchez C; Puente-Ferreiro J; Moreno C; Diaz A; Cabello-Clotet N; Vinuesa D; Blanco JL; Melús E; Gómez-Ayerbe C; Olalla J; Riera M; Bernardino JI; de López Bernaldo de Quirós JC; Moreno S; Jarrín I";"Izquierdo R; Suárez-García I; Gómez-García T; Marco-Sánchez C; Puente-Ferreiro J; Moreno C; Diaz A; Cabello-Clotet N; Vinuesa D; Blanco JL; Melús E; Gómez-Ayerbe C; Olalla J; Riera M; Bernardino JI; de López Bernaldo de Quirós JC; Moreno S; Jarrín I.

10.1128/aac.00414-23;Ceftolozane-Tazobactam against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Isolates in the Hollow-Fiber Infection Model: Challenges Imposed by Hypermutability and Heteroresistance.;"Pseudomonas aeruginosa remains a challenge in chronic respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis (CF). Ceftolozane-tazobactam has not yet been evaluated against multidrug-resistant hypermutable P. aeruginosa isolates in the hollow-fiber infection model (HFIM). Isolates CW41, CW35, and CW44 (ceftolozane-tazobactam MICs of 4, 4, and 2 mg/L, respectively) from adults with CF were exposed to simulated representative epithelial lining fluid pharmacokinetics of ceftolozane-tazobactam in the HFIM. Regimens were continuous infusion (CI; 4.5 g/day to 9 g/day, all isolates) and 1-h infusions (1.5 g every 8 hours and 3 g every 8 hours, CW41). Whole-genome sequencing and mechanism-based modeling were performed for CW41. CW41 (in four of five biological replicates) and CW44 harbored preexisting resistant subpopulations; CW35 did not. For replicates 1 to 4 of CW41 and CW44, 9 g/day CI decreased bacterial counts to <3 log10 CFU/mL for 24 to 48 h, followed by regrowth and resistance amplification. Replicate 5 of CW41 had no preexisting subpopulations and was suppressed below ~3 log10 CFU/mL for 120 h by 9 g/day CI, followed by resistant regrowth. Both CI regimens reduced CW35 bacterial counts to <1 log10 CFU/mL by 120 h without regrowth. These results corresponded with the presence or absence of preexisting resistant subpopulations and resistance-associated mutations at baseline. Mutations in ampC, algO, and mexY were identified following CW41 exposure to ceftolozane-tazobactam at 167 to 215 h. Mechanism-based modeling well described total and resistant bacterial counts. The findings highlight the impact of heteroresistance and baseline mutations on the effect of ceftolozane-tazobactam and limitations of MIC to predict bacterial outcomes. The resistance amplification in two of three isolates supports current guidelines that ceftolozane-tazobactam should be utilized together with another antibiotic against P. aeruginosa in CF.";2023;Aug;Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy;"Tait JR; Harper M; Cortés-Lara S; Rogers KE; López-Causapé C; Smallman TR; Lang Y; Lee WL; Zhou J; Bulitta JB; Nation RL; Boyce JD; Oliver A; Landersdorfer CB";"Tait JR; Harper M; Cortés-Lara S; Rogers KE; López-Causapé C; Smallman TR; Lang Y; Lee WL; Zhou J; Bulitta JB; Nation RL; Boyce JD; Oliver A; Landersdorfer CB.

In this study, we evaluated the molecular characteristics of 300 globally collected clinical P. aeruginosa isolates non-susceptible (NS) to CZA, C/T, or both agents. Isolates were CZA-NS and C/T-NS (n = 57), CZA-susceptible (S) and C/T-NS (n = 145), or CZA-NS and C/T-S (n = 98) selected from the Antimicrobial Testing Leadership and Surveillance (ATLAS) surveillance program from 2020 to 2021. Characterization was by whole-genome sequencing. Analysis was performed to identify β-lactamase genes and mutations that impact efflux regulation, AmpC regulation, and target binding (PBP3). Of the 57 CZA-NS+C/T-NS isolates, 64.9% carried a metallo-β-lactamase (MBL), and a cumulative 84.2% carried any non-intrinsic β-lactamase [i.e., not Pseudomonas-derived cephalosporinase (PDC) or OXA-50-like]. Of the 145 CZA-S+C/T-NS isolates, 26.2% carried an extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and no carbapenemase, 17.9% carried a serine-carbapenemase, and 42.1% were negative for non-intrinsic β-lactamases. Of 98 CZA-NS+C/T-S isolates, 34.7% carried mutations previously described as causing an upregulation of the MexAB-OprM efflux pump, while only 9.2% carried a non-intrinsic β-lactamase, and no resistance mechanism was identified in 29.6% of these isolates. MBLs were present in most isolates NS to both agents. More than half of the CZA-S+C/T-NS isolates carried serine β-lactamases. The most frequently identified resistance mechanism identified in CZA-NS+C/T-S isolates was a marker indicating the upregulation of MexAB-OprM. No mechanism was identified that is thought to support resistance to these agents in numerous isolates.

10.1128/aac.01315-23;Transferable AmpCs in Klebsiella pneumoniae: interplay with peptidoglycan recycling, mechanisms of hyperproduction, and virulence implications.;Chromosomal and transferable AmpC β-lactamases represent top resistance mechanisms in different gram-negatives, but knowledge regarding the latter, mostly concerning regulation and virulence-related implications, is far from being complete. To fill this gap, we used Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) and two different plasmid-encoded AmpCs [DHA-1 (AmpR regulator linked, inducible) and CMY-2 (constitutive)] as models to perform a study in which we show that blockade of peptidoglycan recycling through AmpG permease inactivation abolished DHA-1 inducibility but did not affect CMY-2 production and neither did it alter KP pathogenic behavior. Moreover, whereas regular production of both AmpC-type enzymes did not attenuate KP virulence, when blaDHA-1 was expressed in an ampG-defective mutant, Galleria mellonella killing was significantly (but not drastically) attenuated. Spontaneous DHA-1 hyperproducer mutants were readily obtained in vitro, showing slight or insignificant virulence attenuations together with high-level resistance to β-lactams only mildly affected by basal production (e.g., ceftazidime, ceftolozane/tazobactam). By analyzing diverse DHA-1-harboring clinical KP strains, we demonstrate that the natural selection of these hyperproducers is not exceptional (>10% of the collection), whereas mutational inactivation of the typical AmpC hyperproduction-related gene mpl was the most frequent underlying mechanism. The potential silent dissemination of this kind of strains, for which an important fitness cost-related contention barrier does not seem to exist, is envisaged as a neglected threat for most β-lactams effectiveness, including recently introduced combinations. Analyzing whether this phenomenon is applicable to other transferable β-lactamases and species as well as determining the levels of conferred resistance poses an essential topic to be addressed.IMPORTANCEAlthough there is solid knowledge about the regulation of transferable and especially chromosomal AmpC β-lactamases in Enterobacterales, there are still gaps to fill, mainly related to regulatory mechanisms and virulence interplays of the former. This work addresses them using Klebsiella pneumoniae as model, delving into a barely explored conception: the acquisition of a plasmid-encoded inducible AmpC-type enzyme whose production can be increased through selection of chromosomal mutations, entailing dramatically increased resistance compared to basal expression but minor associated virulence costs. Accordingly, we demonstrate that clinical K. pneumoniae DHA-1 hyperproducer strains are not exceptional. Through this study, we warn for the first time that this phenomenon may be a neglected new threat for β-lactams effectiveness (including some recently introduced ones) silently spreading in the clinical context, not only in K. pneumoniae but potentially also in other pathogens. These facts must be carefully considered in order to design future resistance-preventive strategies.;2024;May;Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy;"Barceló IM; Escobar-Salom M; Cabot G; Perelló-Bauzà P; Jordana-Lluch E; Taltavull B; Torrens G; Rojo-Molinero E; Zamorano L; Pérez A; Oliver A; Juan C";"Barceló IM; Escobar-Salom M; Cabot G; Perelló-Bauzà P; Jordana-Lluch E; Taltavull B; Torrens G; Rojo-Molinero E; Zamorano L; Pérez A; Oliver A; Juan C.

10.1128/aac.01505-22;Antimicrobial Activity of Cefiderocol against the Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacter cloacae Complex and Characterization of Reduced Susceptibility Associated with Metallo-β-Lactamase VIM-1.;"Emergence of cefiderocol resistance among carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales, particularly those in the Enterobacter cloacae complex (ECC), is becoming of alarming concern; however, the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon remains poorly understood. We describe the acquisition of VIM-1-mediated reduced cefiderocol susceptibility (MICs 0.5 to 4 mg/L) in a collection of 54 carbapenemase-producing isolates belonging to the ECC. MICs were determined by reference methodologies. Antimicrobial resistance genomic analysis was performed through hybrid WGS. The impact of VIM-1 production on cefiderocol resistance in the ECC background was examined at microbiological, molecular, biochemical, and atomic levels. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing yielded 83.3% susceptible isolates and MIC50/90 values of 1/4 mg/L. Decreased susceptibility to cefiderocol was mainly associated with isolates producing VIM-1, with cefiderocol MICs 2- to 4-fold higher than for isolates carrying other types of carbapenemases. E. cloacae and Escherichia coli VIM-1 transformants displayed significantly enhanced cefiderocol MICs. Biochemical assays with purified VIM-1 protein revealed low but detectable cefiderocol hydrolysis. Simulation studies revealed how cefiderocol is anchored to the VIM-1 active site. Additional molecular assays and WGS data analysis highlighted the implication of SHV-12 coproduction and suggested the inactivation of the FcuA-like siderophore receptor as further contributors to the higher cefiderocol MICs. Our findings warn of the potential of the VIM-1 carbapenemase to at least partly limit the activity of cefiderocol in the ECC. This effect is probably enhanced due to combination with additional mechanisms, such as ESBL production and siderophore inactivation, and indicates the need for active surveillance to extend the life span of this promising cephalosporin.";2023;May;Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy;"Lasarte-Monterrubio C; Guijarro-Sánchez P; Vázquez-Ucha JC; Alonso-Garcia I; Alvarez-Fraga L; Outeda M; Martinez-Guitian M; Peña-Escolano A; Maceiras R; Lence E; González-Bello C; Arca-Suárez J; Bou G; Beceiro A";"Lasarte-Monterrubio C; Guijarro-Sánchez P; Vázquez-Ucha JC; Alonso-Garcia I; Alvarez-Fraga L; Outeda M; Martinez-Guitian M; Peña-Escolano A; Maceiras R; Lence E; González-Bello C; Arca-Suárez J; Bou G; Beceiro A.

We aimed to analyze the underlying ceftolozane-tazobactam and ceftazidime-avibactam resistance mechanisms in all multidrug-resistant or extensively drug-resistant (MDR/XDR) P. aeruginosa isolates recovered during 1 year (2020) from patients with a documented P. aeruginosa infection. Fifteen isolates showing ceftolozane-tazobactam and ceftazidime-avibactam resistance were evaluated. Clinical conditions, previous positive cultures, and β-lactams received in the previous month were reviewed for each patient. MICs were determined by broth microdilution. Multilocus sequence types (MLSTs) and resistance mechanisms were determined using short- and long-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS). The impact of Pseudomonas-derived cephalosporinases (PDCs) on β-lactam resistance was demonstrated by cloning into an ampC-deficient PAO1 derivative (PAOΔC) and construction of 3D models. Genetic support of acquired β-lactamases was determined in silico from high-quality hybrid assemblies. In most cases, the isolates were recovered after treatment with ceftolozane-tazobactam or ceftazidime-avibactam. Seven isolates from different sequence types (STs) owed their β-lactam resistance to chromosomal mutations and all displayed specific substitutions in PDC: Phe121Leu and Gly222Ser, Pro154Leu, Ala201Thr, Gly214Arg, ΔGly203-Glu219, and Glu219Lys. In the other eight isolates, the ST175 clone was overrepresented (6 isolates) and associated with IMP-28 and IMP-13, whereas two ST1284 isolates produced VIM-2. The cloned PDCs conferred enhanced cephalosporin resistance. The 3D PDC models revealed rearrangements affecting residues involved in cephalosporin hydrolysis. Carbapenemases were chromosomal (VIM-2) or plasmid-borne (IMP-28, IMP-13) and associated with class-1 integrons located in Tn402-like transposition modules.

The MICFTB was >8 mg/L in 6/247 (2.4%) Enterobacterales isolates (3 KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 1 VIM-producing Enterobacter cloacae isolate, 1 IMP-producing E. cloacae isolate, and 1 NDM-producing Escherichia coli isolate) and in 56/170 (32.9%) Pseudomonas isolates, 19 of them carbapenemase producers (15 producers of VIM, 2 of GES, 1 of GES+VIM, and 1 of GES+KPC). Against the Enterobacterales isolates with meropenem MICs of >2 mg/L (138/247), FTB was the most active agent against both serine-β-lactamases (107/138) and MBL producers (31/138) (97.2 and 93.5% MICFTB, ≤8/4 mg/L, respectively), whereas the activity of comparators was reduced, particularly against the MBL producers (ceftazidime-avibactam, 94.4 and 12.9%, meropenem-vaborbactam, 85.0 and 64.5%, imipenem-relebactam, 76.6 and 9.7%, ceftolozane-tazobactam, 1.9 and 0%, and piperacillin-tazobactam, 0 and 0%, respectively). Among the meropenem-resistant Pseudomonas isolates (163/170; MIC, >2 mg/L), the activities of FTB against serine-β-lactamase (35/163) and MBL (43/163) producers were 88.6 and 65.1%, respectively, whereas the susceptibilities of comparators were as follows: ceftazidime-avibactam, 88.5 and 16.0%, meropenem-vaborbactam, 8.5 and 7.0%, imipenem-relebactam, 2.9 and 2.3%, ceftolozane-tazobactam, 0 and 2.3%, and piperacillin-tazobactam, 0 and 0%, respectively. Microbiological results suggest FTB as a potential therapeutic option in patients infected with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas isolates, including MBL producers.";2022;Mar;Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy;"Hernández-García M; García-Castillo M; Ruiz-Garbajosa P; Bou G; Siller-Ruiz M; Pitart C; Gracia-Ahufinger I; Mulet X; Pascual Á; Tormo N; Cantón R";"Hernández-García M; García-Castillo M; Ruiz-Garbajosa P; Bou G; Siller-Ruiz M; Pitart C; Gracia-Ahufinger I; Mulet X; Pascual Á; Tormo N; Cantón R.

10.1128/msphere.00729-23;Clinical, microbiological, and molecular characterization of pediatric invasive infections by Streptococcus pyogenes in Spain in a context of global outbreak.;"In December 2022, an alert was published in the UK and other European countries reporting an unusual increase in the incidence of Streptococcus pyogenes infections. Our aim was to describe the clinical, microbiological, and molecular characteristics of group A Streptococcus invasive infections (iGAS) in children prospectively recruited in Spain (September 2022-March 2023), and compare invasive strains with strains causing mild infections. One hundred thirty isolates of S. pyogenes causing infection (102 iGAS and 28 mild infections) were included in the microbiological study: emm typing, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and sequencing for core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST), resistome, and virulome analysis. Clinical data were available from 93 cases and 21 controls. Pneumonia was the most frequent clinical syndrome (41/93; 44.1%), followed by deep tissue abscesses (23/93; 24.7%), and osteoarticular infections (11/93; 11.8%). Forty-six of 93 cases (49.5%) required admission to the pediatric intensive care unit. iGAS isolates mainly belonged to emm1 and emm12; emm12 predominated in 2022 but was surpassed by emm1 in 2023. Spread of M1UK sublineage (28/64 M1 isolates) was communicated for the first time in Spain, but it did not replace the still predominant sublineage M1global (36/64). Furthermore, a difference in emm types compared with the mild cases was observed with predominance of emm1, but also important representativeness of emm12 and emm89 isolates. Pneumonia, the most frequent and severe iGAS diagnosed, was associated with the speA gene, while the ssa superantigen was associated with milder cases. iGAS isolates were mainly susceptible to antimicrobials. cgMLST showed five major clusters: ST28-ST1357/emm1, ST36-ST425/emm12, ST242/emm12.37, ST39/emm4, and ST101-ST1295/emm89 isolates. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a common bacterial pathogen in the pediatric population. In the last months of 2022, an unusual increase in GAS infections was detected in various countries. Certain strains were overrepresented, although the cause of this raise is not clear. In Spain, a significant increase in mild and severe cases was also observed; this study evaluates the clinical characteristics and the strains involved in both scenarios. Our study showed that the increase in incidence did not correlate with an increase in resistance or with an emm types shift. However, there seemed to be a rise in severity, partly related to a greater rate of pneumonia cases. These findings suggest a general increase in iGAS that highlights the need for surveillance. The introduction of whole genome sequencing in the diagnosis and surveillance of iGAS may improve the understanding of antibiotic resistance, virulence, and clones, facilitating its control and personalized treatment.";2024;Mar;mSphere;"Ramírez de Arellano E; Saavedra-Lozano J; Villalón P; Jové-Blanco A; Grandioso D; Sotelo J; Gamell A; González-López JJ; Cervantes E; Gónzalez MJ; Rello-Saltor V; Esteva C; Sanz-Santaeufemia F; Yagüe G; Manzanares Á; Brañas P; Ruiz de Gopegui E; Carrasco-Colom J; García F; Cercenado E; Mellado I; Del Castillo E; Pérez-Vazquez M; Oteo-Iglesias J; Calvo C";"Ramírez de Arellano E; Saavedra-Lozano J; Villalón P; Jové-Blanco A; Grandioso D; Sotelo J; Gamell A; González-López JJ; Cervantes E; Gónzalez MJ; Rello-Saltor V; Esteva C; Sanz-Santaeufemia F; Yagüe G; Manzanares Á; Brañas P; Ruiz de Gopegui E; Carrasco-Colom J; García F; Cercenado E; Mellado I; Del Castillo E; Pérez-Vazquez M; Oteo-Iglesias J; Calvo C.

10.1128/spectrum.00358-24;In vitro activity of human defensins HNP-1 and hBD-3 against multidrug-resistant ESKAPE Gram-negatives of clinical origin and selected peptidoglycan recycling-defective mutants.;The use of immune compounds as antimicrobial adjuvants is a classic idea recovering timeliness in the current antibiotic resistance scenario. However, the activity of certain antimicrobial peptides against ESKAPE Gram-negatives has not been sufficiently investigated. The objective of this study was to determine the activities of human defensins HNP-1 and hBD-3 alone or combined with permeabilizing/peptidoglycan-targeting agents against clinical ESKAPE Gram-negatives [Acinetobacter baumannii (AB), Enterobacter cloacae (EC), Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), and acute/chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA)]. Lethal concentrations (LCs) of HNP-1 and hBD-3 were determined in four collections of multidrug resistant EC, AB, KP, and PA clinical strains (10-36 isolates depending on the collection). These defensins act through membrane permeabilization plus peptidoglycan building blockade, enabling that alterations in peptidoglycan recycling may increase their activity, which is why different recycling-defective mutants were also included. Combinations with physiological lysozyme and subinhibitory colistin for bactericidal activities determination, and with meropenem for minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were also assessed. HNP-1 showed undetectable activity (LC > 32 mg/L for all strains). hBD-3 showed appreciable activities: LC ranges 2-16, 8-8, 8->32, and 8->32 mg/L for AB, EC, KP, and PA, being PA strains from cystic fibrosis significantly more resistant than acute origin ones. None of the peptidoglycan recycling-defective mutants showed greater susceptibility to HNP-1/hBD-3. Combination with colistin or lysozyme did not change their bactericidal power, and virtually neither did meropenem + hBD-3 compared to meropenem MICs. This is the first study comparatively analyzing the HNP-1/hBD-3 activities against the ESKAPE Gram-negatives, and demonstrates interesting bactericidal capacities of hBD-3 mostly against AB and EC. In the current scenario of critical need for new antimicrobials against multidrug-resistant bacteria, all options must be considered, including classic ideas such as the use of purified immune compounds. However, information regarding the activity of certain human defensins against ESKAPE Gram-negatives was incomplete. This is the first study comparatively assessing the in vitro activity of two membrane-permeabilizing/peptidoglycan construction-blocking defensins (HNP-1 and hBD-3) against relevant clinical collections of ESKAPE Gram-negatives, alone or in combination with permeabilizers, additional peptidoglycan-targeting attacks, or the blockade of its recycling. Our data suggest that hBD-3 has a notable bactericidal activity against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacter cloacae strains that should be considered as potential adjuvant option. Our results suggest for the first time an increased resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains from chronic infection compared to acute origin ones, and provide new clues about the predominant mode of action of hBD-3 against Gram-negatives (permeabilization rather than peptidoglycan-targeting).;2024;Apr;Microbiology spectrum;"Escobar-Salom M; Barceló IM; Rojo-Molinero E; Jordana-Lluch E; Cabot G; Oliver A; Juan C";"Escobar-Salom M; Barceló IM; Rojo-Molinero E; Jordana-Lluch E; Cabot G; Oliver A; Juan C.

10.1128/spectrum.00692-23;Penicillin-Binding Protein Occupancy Dataset for 18 β-Lactams and 4 β-Lactamase Inhibitors in Neisseria gonorrhoeae.;"The lack of effective first-line antibiotic treatments against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and the worldwide dissemination of resistant strains, are the main drivers of a worsening global health crisis. β-lactam antibiotics have been the backbone of therapeutic armamentarium against gonococci. However, we are lacking critical insights to design rationally optimized therapies. In the present work, we generated the first PBP-binding data set on 18 currently available and clinically relevant β-lactams and 4 β-lactamase inhibitors in two N. gonorrhoeae ATCC type collection strains, 19424 and 49226 (PBP2 type XXII and A39T change in mtrR). PBP binding (IC50) was determined via the Bocillin FL binding assay in isolated membrane preparations. Three clusters of differential PBP IC50s were identified and were mostly consistent across both strains, but with quantitative differences. Carbapenems were coselective for PBP2 and PBP3 (0.01 to 0.03 mg/L). Third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins cefixime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, and ceftriaxone showed the lowest IC50 values for PBP2 (0.01 mg/L), whereas cefoxitin, ceftaroline, and ceftolozane required higher concentrations (0.04 to >2 mg/L). Aztreonam was selective for PBP2 in both strains (0.03 to 0.07 mg/L); amdinocillin bound this PBP at higher concentrations (1.33 to 2.94 mg/L). Penicillins specifically targeted PBP2 in strain ATCC 19424 (0.02 to 0.19 mg/L) and showed limited inhibition in strain ATCC 49226 (0.01 to >2 mg/L). Preferential PBP2 binding was observed by β-lactam-based β-lactamase inhibitors sulbactam and tazobactam (1.07 to 6.02 mg/L); meanwhile, diazabicyclooctane inhibitors relebactam and avibactam were selective for PBP3 (1.27 to 5.40 mg/L). This data set will set the bar for future studies that will help the rational use and translational development of antibiotics against multidrug-resistant (MDR) N. gonorrhoeae. IMPORTANCE The manuscript represents the first N. gonorrhoeae PBP-binding data set for 22 chemically different drugs in two type strains with different genetic background. We have identified three clusters of drugs according to their PBP binding IC50s and highlighted the binding differences across the two strains studied. With the currently available genomic information and the PBP-binding data, we have been able to correlate the target attainment differences and the mutations that affect the drug uptake with the MIC changes. The results of the current work will allow us to develop molecular tools of great practical use for the study and the design of new rationally designed therapies capable of combating the growing MDR gonococci threat.";2023;Jun;Microbiology spectrum;"López-Argüello S; Montaner M; Mármol-Salvador A; Velázquez-Escudero A; Docobo-Pérez F; Oliver A; Moya B";"López-Argüello S; Montaner M; Mármol-Salvador A; Velázquez-Escudero A; Docobo-Pérez F; Oliver A; Moya B.

10.1128/spectrum.00723-22;Low Ciprofloxacin Concentrations Select Multidrug-Resistant Mutants Overproducing Efflux Pumps in Clinical Isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.;"Low antibiotic concentrations present in natural environments are a severe and often neglected threat to public health. Even if they are present below their MICs, they may select for antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Notably, the minimal subinhibitory concentrations that select resistant bacteria, and define the respective sub-MIC selective windows, differ between antibiotics. The establishment of these selective concentrations is needed for risk-assessment studies regarding the presence of antibiotics in different habitats. Using short-term evolution experiments in a set of 12 Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates (including high-risk clones with ubiquitous distribution), we have determined that ciprofloxacin sub-MIC selective windows are strain specific and resistome dependent. Nonetheless, in all cases, clinically relevant multidrug-resistant (MDR) mutants emerged upon exposure to low ciprofloxacin concentrations, with these concentrations being below the levels reported in ciprofloxacin-polluted natural habitats where P. aeruginosa can be present. This feature expands the conditions and habitats where clinically relevant quinolone-resistant mutants can emerge. In addition, we established the lowest concentration threshold beyond which P. aeruginosa, regardless of the strain, becomes resistant to ciprofloxacin. Three days of exposure under this sub-MIC ""risk concentration"" led to the selection of MDR mutants that displayed resistance mechanisms usually ascribed to high selective pressures, i.e., the overproduction of the efflux pumps MexCD-OprJ and MexEF-OprN. From a One-Health viewpoint, these data stress the transcendent role of low drug concentrations, which can be encountered in natural ecosystems, in aggravating the antibiotic resistance problem, especially when it comes to pathogens of environmental origin. IMPORTANCE It has been established that antibiotic concentrations below MICs can select antibiotic-resistant pathogens, a feature of relevance for analyzing the role of nonclinical ecosystems in antibiotic resistance evolution. The range of concentrations where this selection occurs defines the sub-MIC selective window, whose width depends on the antibiotic. Herein, we have determined the ciprofloxacin sub-MIC selective windows of a set of Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates (including high-risk clones with worldwide distribution) and established the lowest concentration threshold, notably an amount reported to be present in natural ecosystems, beyond which this pathogen acquires resistance. Importantly, our results show that this ciprofloxacin sub-MIC selects for multidrug-resistant mutants overproducing clinically relevant efflux pumps. From a One-Health angle, this information supports that low antimicrobial concentrations, present in natural environments, may have a relevant role in worsening the antibiotic resistance crisis, particularly regarding pathogens with environmental niches, such as P. aeruginosa.";2022;Oct;Microbiology spectrum;"Sanz-García F; Hernando-Amado S; López-Causapé C; Oliver A; Martínez JL";"Sanz-García F; Hernando-Amado S; López-Causapé C; Oliver A; Martínez JL.

10.1128/spectrum.00892-22;Comparison of Ceftolozane/Tazobactam Infusion Regimens in a Hollow-Fiber Infection Model against Extensively Drug-Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa Isolates.;The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of intermittent (1-h), extended (4-h), and continuous ceftolozane-tazobactam (C/T) infusion against three extensively drug-resistant (XDR) sequence type (ST) 175 P. aeruginosa isolates with different susceptibilities to C/T (MIC = 2 to 16 mg/L) in a 7-day hollow-fiber infection model (HFIM). C/T in continuous infusion achieved the largest reduction in total number of bacterial colonies in the overall treatment arms for both C/T-susceptible and -resistant isolates. It was also the only regimen with bactericidal activity against all three isolates. These data suggest that continuous C/T infusion should be considered a potential treatment for infections caused by XDR P. aeruginosa isolates, including nonsusceptible ones. Proper use of C/T dosing regimens may lead to better clinical management of XDR P. aeruginosa infections. IMPORTANCE Ceftolozane-tazobactam (C/T) is an antipseudomonal antibiotic with a high clinical impact in treating infection caused by extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, but resistance is emerging. Given its time-dependent behavior, C/T continuous infusion can improve exposure and therefore the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment. We compared the efficacy of intermittent, extended, and continuous C/T infusion against three XDR ST175 P. aeruginosa isolates with different C/T MICs by means of an in vitro dynamic hollow-fiber model. We demonstrated that C/T in continuous infusion achieved the largest reduction in bacterial density in the overall treatment arms for both susceptible and resistant isolates. It was also the only regimen with bactericidal activity against all three isolates. Through this study, we want to demonstrate that developing individually tailored antimicrobial treatments is becoming essential. Our results support the role of C/T level monitoring and of dose adjustments for better clinical management and outcomes.;2022;Jun;Microbiology spectrum;"Montero MM; Domene-Ochoa S; López-Causapé C; López-Montesinos I; Luque S; Sorlí L; Campillo N; Padilla E; Prim N; Ferrer Alapont L; Grau S; Oliver A; Horcajada JP";"Montero MM; Domene-Ochoa S; López-Causapé C; López-Montesinos I; Luque S; Sorlí L; Campillo N; Padilla E; Prim N; Ferrer Alapont L; Grau S; Oliver A; Horcajada JP.

10.1128/spectrum.01329-23;CRISPR-Cas13a-Based Assay for Accurate Detection of OXA-48 and GES Carbapenemases.;"Carbapenem-resistant pathogens have been recognized as a health concern as they are both difficult to treat and detect in clinical microbiology laboratories. Researchers are making great efforts to develop highly specific, sensitive, accurate, and rapid diagnostic techniques, required to prevent the spread of these microorganisms and improve the prognosis of patients. In this context, CRISPR-Cas systems are proposed as promising tools for the development of diagnostic methods due to their high specificity; the Cas13a endonuclease can discriminate single nucleotide changes and displays collateral cleavage activity against single-stranded RNA molecules when activated. This technology is usually combined with isothermal pre-amplification reactions in order to increase its sensitivity. We have developed a new LAMP-CRISPR-Cas13a-based assay for the detection of OXA-48 and GES carbapenemases in clinical samples without the need for nucleic acid purification and concentration. To evaluate the assay, we used 68 OXA-48-like-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates as well as 64 Enterobacter cloacae complex GES-6, 14 Pseudomonas aeruginosa GES-5, 9 Serratia marcescens GES-6, 5 P. aeruginosa GES-6, and 3 P. aeruginosa (GES-15, GES-27, and GES-40) and 1 K. pneumoniae GES-2 isolates. The assay, which takes less than 2 h and costs approximately 10 € per reaction, exhibited 100% specificity and sensitivity (99% confidence interval [CI]) for both OXA-48 and all GES carbapenemases. IMPORTANCE Carbapenems are one of the last-resort antibiotics for defense against multidrug-resistant pathogens. Multiple nucleic acid amplification methods, including multiplex PCR, multiplex loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and multiplex RPAs, can achieve rapid, accurate, and simultaneous detection of several resistance genes to carbapenems in a single reaction. However, these assays need thermal cycling steps and specialized instruments, giving them limited application in the field.

10.1128/spectrum.02019-21;Impact of Peptidoglycan Recycling Blockade and Expression of Horizontally Acquired β-Lactamases on Pseudomonas aeruginosa Virulence.;In the current scenario of antibiotic resistance magnification, new weapons against top nosocomial pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa are urgently needed. The interplay between β-lactam resistance and virulence is considered a promising source of targets to be attacked by antivirulence therapies, and in this regard, we previously showed that a peptidoglycan recycling blockade dramatically attenuated the pathogenic power of P. aeruginosa strains hyperproducing the chromosomal β-lactamase AmpC. Here, we sought to ascertain whether this observation could be applicable to other β-lactamases. To do so, P. aeruginosa wild-type or peptidoglycan recycling-defective strains (ΔampG and ΔnagZ) harboring different cloned β-lactamases (transferable GES, VIM, and OXA types) were used to assess their virulence in Galleria mellonella larvae by determining 50% lethal doses (LD50s). A mild yet significant LD50 increase was observed after peptidoglycan recycling disruption per se, whereas the expression of class A and B enzymes did not impact virulence. While the production of the narrow-spectrum class D OXA-2 entailed a slight attenuation, its extended-spectrum derivatives OXA-226 (W159R [bearing a change of W to R at position 159]), OXA-161 (N148D), and principally, OXA-539 (D149 duplication) were associated with outstanding virulence impairments, especially in recycling-defective backgrounds (with some LD50s being >1,000-fold that of the wild type). Although their exact molecular bases remain to be deciphered, these results suggest that mutations affecting the catalytic center and, therefore, the hydrolytic spectrum of OXA-2-derived enzymes also drastically impact the pathogenic power of P. aeruginosa. This work provides new and relevant knowledge to the complex topic of the interplay between the production of β-lactamases and virulence that could be useful to build future therapeutic strategies against P. aeruginosa. IMPORTANCE Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the leading nosocomial pathogens whose growing resistance makes the development of therapeutic options extremely urgent. The resistance-virulence interplay has classically aroused researchers' interest as a source of therapeutic targets. In this regard, we describe a wide array of virulence attenuations associated with different transferable β-lactamases, among which the production of OXA-2-derived extended-spectrum β-lactamases stood out as a dramatic handicap for pathogenesis, likely as a side effect of mutations causing the expansion of their hydrolytic spectrums. Moreover, our results confirm the validity of disturbing peptidoglycan recycling as a weapon to attenuate P. aeruginosa virulence in class C and D β-lactamase production backgrounds. In the current scenario of dissemination of horizontally acquired β-lactamases, this work brings out new data on the complex interplay between the production of specific enzymes and virulence attenuation that, if complemented with the characterization of the underlying mechanisms, will likely be exploitable to develop future virulence-targeting antipseudomonal strategies.;2022;Feb;Microbiology spectrum;"Barceló IM; Torrens G; Escobar-Salom M; Jordana-Lluch E; Capó-Bauzá MM; Ramón-Pallín C; García-Cuaresma D; Fraile-Ribot PA; Mulet X; Oliver A; Juan C";"Barceló IM; Torrens G; Escobar-Salom M; Jordana-Lluch E; Capó-Bauzá MM; Ramón-Pallín C; García-Cuaresma D; Fraile-Ribot PA; Mulet X; Oliver A; Juan C.

10.1128/spectrum.02276-22;Rapid Phenotypic Convergence towards Collateral Sensitivity in Clinical Isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Presenting Different Genomic Backgrounds.;Collateral sensitivity (CS) is an evolutionary trade-off by which acquisition of resistance to an antibiotic leads to increased susceptibility to another. This Achilles' heel of antibiotic resistance could be exploited to design evolution-based strategies for treating bacterial infections. To date, most studies in the field have focused on the identification of CS patterns in model strains. However, one of the main requirements for the clinical application of this trade-off is that it must be robust and has to emerge in different genomic backgrounds, including preexisting drug-resistant isolates, since infections are frequently caused by pathogens already resistant to antibiotics. Here, we report the first analysis of CS robustness in clinical strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa presenting different ab initio mutational resistomes. We identified a robust CS pattern associated with short-term evolution in the presence of ciprofloxacin of clinical P. aeruginosa isolates, including representatives of high-risk epidemic clones belonging to sequence type (ST) 111, ST175, and ST244. We observed the acquisition of different ciprofloxacin resistance mutations in strains presenting varied STs and different preexisting mutational resistomes. Importantly, despite these genetic differences, the use of ciprofloxacin led to a robust CS to aztreonam and tobramycin. In addition, we describe the possible application of this evolutionary trade-off to drive P. aeruginosa infections to extinction by using the combination of ciprofloxacin-tobramycin or ciprofloxacin-aztreonam. Our results support the notion that the identification of robust patterns of CS may establish the basis for developing evolution-informed treatment strategies to tackle bacterial infections, including those due to antibiotic-resistant pathogens. IMPORTANCE Collateral sensitivity (CS) is a trade-off of antibiotic resistance evolution that could be exploited to design strategies for treating bacterial infections. Clinical application of CS requires it to robustly emerge in different genomic backgrounds. In this study, we performed an analysis to identify robust patterns of CS associated with the use of ciprofloxacin in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa presenting different mutational resistomes and including high-risk epidemic clones (ST111, ST175, and ST244). We demonstrate the robustness of CS to tobramycin and aztreonam and the potential application of this evolutionary observation to drive P. aeruginosa infections to extinction. Our results support the notion that the identification of robust CS patterns may establish the basis for developing evolutionary strategies to tackle bacterial infections, including those due to antibiotic-resistant pathogens.;2023;Feb;Microbiology spectrum;"Hernando-Amado S; López-Causapé C; Laborda P; Sanz-García F; Oliver A; Martínez JL";"Hernando-Amado S; López-Causapé C; Laborda P; Sanz-García F; Oliver A; Martínez JL.

10.1128/spectrum.02700-22;Role of Enzymatic Activity in the Biological Cost Associated with the Production of AmpC β-Lactamases in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.;"In the current scenario of growing antibiotic resistance, understanding the interplay between resistance mechanisms and biological costs is crucial for designing therapeutic strategies. In this regard, intrinsic AmpC β-lactamase hyperproduction is probably the most important resistance mechanism of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, proven to entail important biological burdens that attenuate virulence mostly under peptidoglycan recycling alterations. P. aeruginosa can acquire resistance to new β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combinations (ceftazidime-avibactam and ceftolozane-tazobactam) through mutations affecting ampC and its regulatory genes, but the impact of these mutations on the associated biological cost and the role that β-lactamase activity plays per se in contributing to the above-mentioned virulence attenuation are unknown. The same questions remain unsolved for plasmid-encoded AmpC-type β-lactamases such as FOX enzymes, some of which also provide resistance to new β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combinations. Here, we assessed from different perspectives the effects of changes in the active center and, thus, in the hydrolytic spectrum resistance to inhibitors of AmpC-type β-lactamases on the fitness and virulence of P. aeruginosa, using site-directed mutagenesis; the previously described AmpC variants T96I, G183D, and ΔG229-E247; and, finally, blaFOX-4 versus blaFOX-8. Our results indicate the essential role of AmpC activity per se in causing the reported full virulence attenuation (in terms of growth, motility, cytotoxicity, and Galleria mellonella larvae killing), although the biological cost of the above-mentioned AmpC-type variants was similar to that of the wild-type enzymes. This suggests that there is not an important biological burden that may limit the selection/spread of these variants, which could progressively compromise the future effectiveness of the above-mentioned drug combinations. IMPORTANCE The growing antibiotic resistance of the top nosocomial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa pushes research to explore new therapeutic strategies, for which the resistance-versus-virulence balance is a promising source of targets. While resistance often entails significant biological costs, little is known about the bases of the virulence attenuations associated with a resistance mechanism as extraordinarily relevant as β-lactamase production. We demonstrate that besides potential energy and cell wall alterations, the enzymatic activity of the P. aeruginosa cephalosporinase AmpC is essential for causing the full attenuation associated with its hyperproduction by affecting different features related to pathogenesis, a fact exploitable from the antivirulence perspective. Less encouraging, we also show that the production of different chromosomal/plasmid-encoded AmpC derivatives conferring resistance to some of the newest antibiotic combinations causes no significantly increased biological burdens, which suggests a free way for the selection/spread of these types of variants, potentially compromising the future effectiveness of these antipseudomonal therapies.";2022;Oct;Microbiology spectrum;"Barceló IM; Jordana-Lluch E; Escobar-Salom M; Torrens G; Fraile-Ribot PA; Cabot G; Mulet X; Zamorano L; Juan C; Oliver A";"Barceló IM; Jordana-Lluch E; Escobar-Salom M; Torrens G; Fraile-Ribot PA; Cabot G; Mulet X; Zamorano L; Juan C; Oliver A.

10.1128/spectrum.02927-22;Imipenem-Relebactam Susceptibility in Enterobacterales Isolates Recovered from ICU Patients from Spain and Portugal (SUPERIOR and STEP Studies).;"Imipenem-relebactam is a novel β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combination. We evaluated the in vitro activity of imipenem-relebactam and comparators against Enterobacterales clinical isolates recovered in 8 Spanish and 11 Portuguese intensive care units (ICUs) (SUPERIOR, 2016-2017; STEP, 2017-2018). Overall, 747 Enterobacterales isolates (378 Escherichia coli, 252 Klebsiella spp., 64 Enterobacter spp., and 53 other species) were prospectively collected from ICU patients with complicated intraabdominal (cIAI), complicated urinary tract (cUTI), and lower respiratory tract (LRTI) infections. MICs were determined (ISO-broth microdilution), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed in a subset of isolates displaying susceptible and resistant imipenem-relebactam MICs. Imipenem-relebactam (98.7% susceptible) showed similar activity to ceftazidime-avibactam (99.5% susceptible) and higher than ceftolozane-tazobactam (86.9% susceptible). Imipenem-relebactam was inactive against 1.3% (10/747) isolates, all of them due to carbapenemase production (9 K. pneumoniae and 1 E. cloacae). Imipenem-relebactam was active against 100% of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-E. coli and ESBL-Klebsiella spp. isolates and 80.4% of carbapenemase-Klebsiella spp. producers. Carbapenemase genes were confirmed by WGS in 41 Klebsiella spp.: OXA-48 (20/41), KPC-3 (14/41), OXA-181 (4/41), NDM-1 (1/41), OXA-48 + VIM-2 (1/41), and KPC-3 + VIM-2 (1/41). In Klebsiella spp. isolates, relebactam restored imipenem susceptibility in all KPC-3 producers, and resistant isolates (7/41) were mostly OXA-48 + CTX-M-15-K. pneumoniae high-risk clones (7/9). Intercountry differences were detected as follows: OXA-48 (17/21) was dominant in Spain, unlike KPC-3 (14/15) in Portugal. Imipenem-relebactam was 100% active against CTX-M-15-ST131-H30Rx-E. coli high-risk clone, predominant in both countries. Our results depict the potential role of imipenem-relebactam in ICU patients with cIAIs, cUTIs, and LRTIs due to wild-type ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales, particularly KPC producers. IMPORTANCE We comparatively evaluate the in vitro activity of a drug combination consisting of a carbapenem (imipenem) and a novel inhibitor of beta-lactamases (relebactam), a mechanism that destroys beta-lactam antibiotics. We assess the activity against a collection of Enterobacterales clinical isolates recovered from difficult-to-treat infections in patients admitted to different intensive care units in Portugal and Spain. Imipenem-relebactam shows excellent activity in avoiding common resistance mechanisms in this setting, such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases widely distributed, including KPCs. We show few resistant isolates (<2%). Molecular characterization by whole-genome sequencing shows that most of the resistant isolates produced specific carbapenemase, such as OXA-48 or metalo-betalactamases. Our study updates the activity of imipenem-relebactam in light of current epidemiology in a hospital setting in which the use of this combination is needed due to the presence of infections due to multidrug-resistant isolates.";2022;Oct;Microbiology spectrum;"Hernández-García M; García-Castillo M; Bou G; Cercenado E; Delgado-Valverde M; Oliver A; Pitart C; Rodríguez-Lozano J; Tormo N; Melo-Cristino J; Pinto MF; Gonçalves E; Alves V; Vieira AR; Ramalheira E; Sancho L; Diogo J; Ferreira R; Cruz H; Chaves C; Duarte J; Pássaro L; Díaz-Regañón J; Cantón R";"Hernández-García M; García-Castillo M; Bou G; Cercenado E; Delgado-Valverde M; Oliver A; Pitart C; Rodríguez-Lozano J; Tormo N; Melo-Cristino J; Pinto MF; Gonçalves E; Alves V; Vieira AR; Ramalheira E; Sancho L; Diogo J; Ferreira R; Cruz H; Chaves C; Duarte J; Pássaro L; Díaz-Regañón J; Cantón R.

10.1128/spectrum.03038-22;PBP Target Profiling by β-Lactam and β-Lactamase Inhibitors in Intact Pseudomonas aeruginosa: Effects of the Intrinsic and Acquired Resistance Determinants on the Periplasmic Drug Availability.;The lack of effective treatment options against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the main contributors to the silent pandemic. Many antibiotics are ineffective against resistant isolates due to poor target site penetration, efflux, or β-lactamase hydrolysis. Critical insights to design optimized antimicrobial therapies and support translational drug development are needed. In the present work, we analyzed the periplasmic drug uptake and binding to PBPs of 11 structurally different β-lactams and 4 β-lactamase inhibitors (BLIs) in P. aeruginosa PAO1. The contribution of the most prevalent β-lactam resistance mechanisms to MIC and periplasmic target attainment was also assessed. Bacterial cultures (6.5 log10 CFU/mL) were exposed to 1/2× PAO1 MIC of each antibiotic for 30 min. Unbound PBPs were labeled with Bocillin FL and analyzed using a FluorImager. Imipenem extensively inactivated all targets. Cephalosporins preferentially targeted PBP1a and PBP3. Aztreonam and amdinocillin bound exclusively to PBP3 and to PBP2 and PBP4, respectively. Penicillins bound preferentially to PBP1a, PBP1b, and PBP3. BLIs displayed poor PBP occupancy. Inactivation of oprD elicited a notable reduction of imipenem target attainment, and it was to a lesser extent in the other carbapenems. Improved PBP occupancy was observed for the main targets of the widely used antipseudomonal penicillins, cephalosporins, meropenem, aztreonam, and amdinocillin upon oprM inactivation, in line with MIC changes. AmpC constitutive hyperexpression caused a substantial PBP occupancy reduction for the penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam. Data obtained in this work will support the rational design of optimized β-lactam-based combination therapies against resistant P. aeruginosa infections. IMPORTANCE The growing problem of antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative pathogens is linked to three key aspects, (i) the progressive worldwide epidemic spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR), and pandrug-resistant (PDR) Gram-negative strains, (ii) a decrease in the number of effective new antibiotics against multiresistant isolates, and (iii) the lack of mechanistically informed combinations and dosing strategies. Our combined efforts should focus not only on the development of new antimicrobial agents but the adequate administration of these in combination with other agents currently available in the clinic. Our work determined the effectiveness of these compounds in the clinically relevant bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the molecular level, assessing the net influx rate and their ability to access their targets and achieve bacterial killing without generating resistance. The data generated in this work will be helpful for translational drug development.;2023;Feb;Microbiology spectrum;"Montaner M; Lopez-Argüello S; Oliver A; Moya B";"Montaner M; Lopez-Argüello S; Oliver A; Moya B.

10.1128/spectrum.03836-23;In vitro activity of cefiderocol against European Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., including isolates resistant to meropenem and recent β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations.;"Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. represent major threats and have few approved therapeutic options. Non-‍fermenting Gram-negative isolates were collected from hospitalized inpatients from 49 sites in 6 European countries between 01 January 2020 and 31 December 2020 and underwent susceptibility testing against cefiderocol and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations. Meropenem-resistant (MIC >8 mg/L), cefiderocol-susceptible isolates were analyzed by PCR, and cefiderocol-resistant isolates were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing to identify resistance mechanisms. Overall, 1,451 (950 P. aeruginosa; 501 Acinetobacter spp.) isolates were collected, commonly from the respiratory tract (42.0% and 39.3%, respectively). Cefiderocol susceptibility was higher than ‍β‍-‍l‍a‍c‍t‍a‍m‍/‍β‍-‍l‍a‍c‍t‍a‍mase‍ inhibitor combinations against P. aeruginosa (98.9% vs 83.3%-91.4%), and P. ‍aeruginosa resistant to meropenem (n = 139; 97.8% vs 12.2%-59.7%), β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations (93.6%-98.1% vs 10.7%-71.8%), and both meropenem and ceftazidime-avibactam (96.7% vs 5.0%-‍‍45.0%) or ‍ceftolozane-tazobactam (98.4% vs 8.1%-54.8%), respectively. Cefiderocol and sulbactam-durlobactam susceptibilities were high against Acinetobacter spp. (92.4% and 97.0%) and meropenem-resistant Acineto‍bacter ‍spp. (n = 227; 85.0% and 93.8%) but lower against sulbactam-durlobactam- (n ‍= 15; 13.3%) and cefiderocol- (n = 38; 65.8%) resistant isolates, respectively. Among meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., the most common β-‍‍lactamase genes were metallo-β-lactamases [30/139; blaVIM-2 (15/139)] and oxacillinases [215/227; blaOXA-23 (194/227)], respectively. Acquired β-lactamase genes were identified in 1/10 and 32/38 of cefiderocol-resistant P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., and pirA-like or piuA mutations in 10/10 and 37/38, respectively. Conclusion: cefiderocol susceptibility was high against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., including meropenem-resistant isolates and those resistant to recent β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations common in first-line treatment of European non-fermenters. This was the first study in which the in vitro activity of cefiderocol and non-licensed β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations were directly compared against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., including meropenem- and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination-resistant isolates. A notably large number of European isolates were collected. Meropenem resistance was defined according to the MIC breakpoint for high-dose meropenem, ensuring that data reflect antibiotic activity against isolates that would remain meropenem resistant in the clinic. Cefiderocol susceptibility was high against non-fermenters, and there was no apparent cross resistance between cefiderocol and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, with the exception of sulbactam-durlobactam. These results provide insights into therapeutic options for infections due to resistant P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. and indicate how early susceptibility testing of cefiderocol in parallel with β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations will allow clinicians to choose the effective treatment(s) from all available options.

Overall, 1,909 isolates (including 970 Klebsiella spp., 382 Escherichia coli, and 244 Enterobacter spp.) were collected, commonly from bloodstream infections (43.6%). Cefiderocol susceptibility was higher than approved β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations and largely comparable to cefepime-taniborbactam and aztreonam-avibactam against all Enterobacterales (98.1% vs 78.1%-‍97.4% and 98.7%-99.1%, respectively) and Enterobacterales resistant to meropenem (n = 148, including 125 Klebsiella spp.; 87.8% vs 0%-71.6% and 93.2%-98.6%, respectively), β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations (66.7%-‍92.1% vs 0%-‍88.1% and 66.7%-97.9%, respectively), and to both meropenem and β-‌lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations (61.9%-65.9% vs 0%-‍20.5% and 76.2%-97.7%, respectively). Susceptibilities to approved and developmental β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations against cefiderocol-resistant Enterobacterales (n = 37) were 10.8%-‍56.8% and 78.4%-94.6%, respectively. Most meropenem-resistant Enterobacterales harbored Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (110/148) genes, although metallo-β-lactamase (35/148) and oxacillinase (OXA) carbapenemase (6/148) genes were less common; cefiderocol susceptibility was retained in β-lactamase producers, other than NDM, AmpC, and non-carbapenemase OXA producers. Most cefiderocol-resistant Enterobacterales had multiple resistance mechanisms, including ≥1 iron uptake-related mutation (37/37), carbapenemase gene (33/37), and ftsI mutation (24/37). The susceptibility to cefiderocol was higher than approved β-lac‌tam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations against European Enterobacterales, including meropenem- and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination-resistant isolates. This study collected a notably large number of Enterobacterales isolates from Europe, including meropenem- and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination-resistant isolates against which the in vitro activities of cefiderocol and developmental β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations were directly compared for the first time. The MIC breakpoint for high-dose meropenem was used to define meropenem resistance, so isolates that would remain meropenem resistant with doses clinically available to patients were included in the data. Susceptibility to cefiderocol, as a single active compound, was high against Enterobacterales and was higher than or comparable to available β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations. These results provide insights into the treatment options for infections due to Enterobacterales with resistant phenotypes. Early susceptibility testing of cefiderocol in parallel with β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations will allow patients to receive the most appropriate treatment option(s) available in a timely manner.

10.1186/s12575-022-00181-z;Improved cytometric analysis of untouched lung leukocytes by enzymatic liquefaction of sputum samples.;Phenotyping sputum-resident leukocytes and evaluating their functional status are essential analyses for exploring the cellular basis of pathological processes in the lungs, and flow cytometry is widely recognized as the gold-standard technique to address them. However, sputum-resident leukocytes are found in respiratory samples which need to be liquefied prior to cytometric analysis. Traditional liquefying procedures involve the use of a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol (DTT) in temperature-controlled conditions, which does not homogenize respiratory samples efficiently and impairs cell viability and functionality. Here we propose an enzymatic method that rapidly liquefies samples by means of generating O2 bubbles with endogenous catalase. Sputum specimens from patients with suspected pulmonary infection were treated with DTT, the enzymatic method or PBS. We used turbidimetry to compare the liquefaction degree and cell counts were determined using a hemocytometer. Finally, we conducted a comparative flow cytometry study for evaluating frequencies of sputum-resident neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes and their activation status after liquefaction. Enzymatically treated samples were better liquefied than those treated with DTT or PBS, which resulted in a more accurate cytometric analysis. Frequencies of all cell subsets analyzed within liquefied samples were comparable between liquefaction methods. However, the gentle cell handling rendered by the enzymatic method improves cell viability and retains in vivo functional characteristics of sputum-resident leukocytes (with regard to HLA-DR, CD63 and CD11b expression). In conclusion, the proposed enzymatic liquefaction method improves the cytometric analysis of respiratory samples and leaves the cells widely untouched for properly addressing functional analysis of lung leukocytes.;2022;Nov;Biological procedures online;"Santopolo G; Clemente A; Rojo-Molinero E; Fernández S; Álvarez MC; Oliver A; de la Rica R";"Santopolo G; Clemente A; Rojo-Molinero E; Fernández S; Álvarez MC; Oliver A; de la Rica R.

We aimed to evaluate how syndemic conditions affected HRQoL in PLWH. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 861 PLWH, to determine whether syndemic conditions (monthly income; sexual satisfaction; depressive symptoms; social role satisfaction; social isolation; cognitive function; nicotine dependence; perception of stigma) have an effect on HRQoL. A linear regression model and measures of Additive Interaction (AI) were used to determine the effects of syndemic conditions on HRQoL, controlling for other risk factors. Overall, the most frequently observed were stigma perception (56.9%), poor cognitive function (50.6%) and the perception of social isolation (51.6%). The presence of depressive symptoms was the risk factor most associated with worse Physical Health (PH) (B 3.93, 2.71-5.15) and Mental Health (MH) (B 5.08, 3.81-6.34) in linear regression model. Specifically, an interaction was observed between poor cognitive function and poor satisfaction with social role on worse PH and MH (AI 2.08, 0.14-4.02; AI 2.69, 0.15-5.22, respectively); and low income and perception of stigma (AI 2.98, 0.26-5.71), low income and perception of social isolation (AI 2.79, 0.27-5.32), and low income and poor satisfaction with social role (AI 3.45, 0.99-5.91) on MH.

The need for a more efficient use of antimicrobials have fueled plenty of studies to define the optimal duration for antibiotic treatments, and yet, there still are large areas of uncertainty in common clinical scenarios. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been pointed as a priority for clinical research, but it has been unattended by most randomized trials tackling the effectiveness of short treatments. The study protocol of the SHORTEN-2 trial is presented as a practical example of new ways to approach common obstacles for clinical research in AMS. To determine whether a 7-day course of antibiotics is superior to 14-day schemes for treating bloodstream infections by P. aeruginosa (BSI-PA). A superiority, open-label, randomized controlled trial will be performed across 30 Spanish hospitals. Adult patients with uncomplicated BSI-PA will be randomized to receive a 7 versus 14-day course of any active antibiotic. The primary endpoint will be the probability for the 7-day group of achieving better outcomes than the control group, assessing altogether clinical effectiveness, severe adverse events, and antibiotic exposure through a DOOR/RADAR analysis. Main secondary endpoints include treatment failure, BSI-PA relapses, and mortality. A superiority design was set for the primary endpoint and non-inferiority for treatment failure, resulting in a sample size of 304 patients. SHORTEN-2 trial aligns with some of the priorities for clinical research in AMS.

Prospective, multicentre cohort study of immunocompetent adult contacts of patients with pulmonary TB tested with QFT-Plus. Contacts with an initial positive QFT-Plus (QFT-i) underwent a second test within 4 weeks (QFT-1), and if negative, underwent a repeat test 4 weeks later (QFT-2). Based on the QFT-2 result, we classified cases as sustained reversion if they remained negative and as temporary reversion if they turned positive. We included 415 contacts, of whom 96 (23.1%) had an initial positive test (QFT-i). Following this, 10 had negative QFT-1 results and 4 (4.2%) of these persisted with a negative result in the QFT-2 (sustained reversions). All four sustained reversions occurred in contacts with IFN-γ concentrations between ≥0.35 and ≤0.99 IU•mL-1 in one or both QFT-i tubes.

We evaluated the incidence and factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis among PLWH. We also assessed factors related to vaccination coverage in the Balearic Islands. A retrospective analytical study was performed, including patients from the Balearic cohort (EVHIA) who were visited at least twice between 1st January 2020 and 31st March 2022. Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare categorical and continuous variables respectively. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were estimated to identify risk factors. A total of 3567 patients with HIV were included. The median age was 51 years (IQR 44-59). Most of them were male (77,3%), from Europe (82,1%) or South America (13,8%). During the study period 1036 patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection (29%). The incidence rate was 153,24 cases per 1000 person-year. After multivariable analysis, men who have sex with men (MSM) were associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted hazard ratio 1,324, 95% CI 1,138-1,540), whereas African origin, tobacco use and complete or booster vaccination coverage were negatively related. Overall, complete vaccination or booster coverage was recorded in 2845 (79,75%) patients.

Optimizing antimicrobial therapy in patients with antibiotic allergy labels has become one of the priorities of antimicrobial stewardship programs in several countries. These guidelines aim to make recommendations for the systematic approach to patients with suspected or confirmed antibiotic allergy based on current evidence. An expert panel (11 members of various scientific societies) formulated questions about the management of patients with suspected or confirmed antibiotic allergy. A systematic literature review was performed by a medical librarian. The questions were distributed among panel members who selected the most relevant references, summarized the evidence, and formulated graded recommendations when possible. The answers to all the questions were finally reviewed by all panel members. A systematic approach to patients with suspected or confirmed antibiotic allergy was recommended to improve antibiotic selection and, consequently, clinical outcomes. A clinically oriented, 3-category risk-stratification strategy was recommended for patients with suspected antibiotic allergy. Complementary assessments should consider both clinical risk category and preferred antibiotic agent. Empirical therapy recommendations for the most relevant clinical syndromes in patients with suspected or confirmed ß-lactam allergy were formulated, as were recommendations on the implementation and monitoring of the impact of the guidelines. Antimicrobial stewardship programs and allergists should design and implement activities that facilitate the most appropriate use of antibiotics in these patients.;2023;Apr;Journal of investigational allergology & clinical immunology;"Paño-Pardo JR; Moreno Rodilla E; Cobo Sacristan S; Cubero Saldaña JL; Periañez Párraga L; Del Pozo León JL; Retamar-Gentil P; Rodríguez Oviedo A; Torres Jaén MJ; Vidal-Cortes P; Colás Sanz C";"Paño-Pardo JR; Moreno Rodilla E; Cobo Sacristan S; Cubero Saldaña JL; Periañez Párraga L; Del Pozo León JL; Retamar-Gentil P; Rodríguez Oviedo A; Torres Jaén MJ; Vidal-Cortes P; Colás Sanz C.

10.3389/fmicb.2021.789731;Multicenter Performance Evaluation of MALDI-TOF MS for Rapid Detection of Carbapenemase Activity in Enterobacterales: The Future of Networking Data Analysis With Online Software.;"In this study, we evaluate the performance of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for rapid detection of carbapenemase activity in Enterobacterales in clinical microbiology laboratories during a multicenter networking validation study. The study was divided into three different stages: ""software design,"" ""intercenter evaluation,"" and ""clinical validation."" First, a standardized procedure with an online software for data analysis was designed. Carbapenem resistance was detected by measuring imipenem hydrolysis and the results were automatically interpreted using the Clover MS data analysis software (Clover BioSoft, Spain). Second, a series of 74 genotypically characterized Enterobacterales (46 carbapenemase-producers and 28 non carbapenemase-producers) were analyzed in 8 international centers to ensure the reproducibility of the method. Finally, the methodology was evaluated independently in all centers during a 2-month period and results were compared with the reference standard for carbapenemase detection used in each center. The overall agreement rate relative to the reference method for carbapenemase resistance detection in clinical samples was 92.5%. The sensitivity was 93.9% and the specificity, 100%. Results were obtained within 60 min and accuracy ranged from 83.3 to 100% among the different centers. Further, our results demonstrate that MALDI-TOF MS is an outstanding tool for rapid detection of carbapenemase activity in Enterobacterales in clinical microbiology laboratories. The use of a simple in-house procedure with online software allows routine screening of carbapenemases in diagnostics, thereby facilitating early and appropriate antimicrobial therapy.";2021;;Frontiers in microbiology;"Gato E; Anantharajah A; Arroyo MJ; Artacho MJ; Caballero JD; Candela A; Chudějová K; Constanso IP; Elías C; Fernández J; Jiménez J; Lumbreras P; Méndez G; Mulet X; Pérez-Palacios P; Rodríguez-Sánchez B; Cantón R; Hrabák J; Mancera L; Martínez-Martínez L; Oliver A; Pascual Á; Verroken A; Bou G; Oviaño M";"Gato E; Anantharajah A; Arroyo MJ; Artacho MJ; Caballero JD; Candela A; Chudějová K; Constanso IP; Elías C; Fernández J; Jiménez J; Lumbreras P; Méndez G; Mulet X; Pérez-Palacios P; Rodríguez-Sánchez B; Cantón R; Hrabák J; Mancera L; Martínez-Martínez L; Oliver A; Pascual Á; Verroken A; Bou G; Oviaño M.

10.3389/fmicb.2021.803827;A Genomic Snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic in the Balearic Islands.;"Objective: To analyze the SARS-CoV-2 genomic epidemiology in the Balearic Islands, a unique setting in which the course of the pandemic has been influenced by a complex interplay between insularity, severe social restrictions and tourism travels. Methods: Since the onset of the pandemic, more than 2,700 SARS-CoV-2 positive respiratory samples have been randomly selected and sequenced in the Balearic Islands. Genetic diversity of circulating variants was assessed by lineage assignment of consensus whole genome sequences with PANGOLIN and investigation of additional spike mutations. Results: Consensus sequences were assigned to 46 different PANGO lineages and 75% of genomes were classified within a VOC, VUI, or VUM variant according to the WHO definitions. Highest genetic diversity was documented in the island of Majorca (42 different lineages detected). Globally, lineages B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2/AY.X were identified as the 2 major lineages circulating in the Balearic Islands during the pandemic, distantly followed by lineages B.1.177/B.1.177.X. However, in Ibiza/Formentera lineage distribution was slightly different and lineage B.1.221 was the third most prevalent. Temporal distribution analysis showed that B.1 and B.1.5 lineages dominated the first epidemic wave, lineage B.1.177 dominated the second and third, and lineage B.1.617.2 the fourth. Of note, lineage B.1.1.7 became the most prevalent circulating lineage during first half of 2021; however, it was not associated with an increased in COVID-19 cases likely due to severe social restrictions and limited travels. Additional spike mutations were rarely documented with the exception of mutation S:Q613H which has been detected in several genomes (n = 25) since July 2021. Conclusion: Virus evolution, mainly driven by the acquisition and selection of spike substitutions conferring biological advantages, social restrictions, and size population are apparently key factors for explaining the epidemic patterns registered in the Balearic Islands.";2021;;Frontiers in microbiology;"López-Causapé C; Fraile-Ribot PA; Jiménez-Serrano S; Cabot G; Del Barrio-Tofiño E; Prado MC; Linares JM; López A; Hurtado A; Riera E; Serra A; Roselló E; Carbó L; Fernández-Baca MV; Gallegos C; Saurina J; Arteaga E; Salom MM; Salvá A; Nicolau A; González-Candelas F; Comas I; Oliver A";"López-Causapé C; Fraile-Ribot PA; Jiménez-Serrano S; Cabot G; Del Barrio-Tofiño E; Prado MC; Linares JM; López A; Hurtado A; Riera E; Serra A; Roselló E; Carbó L; Fernández-Baca MV; Gallegos C; Saurina J; Arteaga E; Salom MM; Salvá A; Nicolau A; González-Candelas F; Comas I; Oliver A.

In total, 71 hospitals, representing all 50 Spanish provinces, collected the first 10 isolates per hospital (February to May 2019); CPE isolates were first identified according to EUCAST (meropenem MIC > 0.12 mg/L with immunochromatography, colorimetric tests, carbapenem inactivation, or carbapenem hydrolysis with MALDI-TOF). Prevalence and incidence were calculated according to population denominators. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the microdilution method (EUCAST). All 403 isolates collected were sequenced for high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing, core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST), and resistome analysis. In total, 377 (93.5%) CP-Kpn and 26 (6.5%) CP-Eco isolates were collected from 62 (87.3%) hospitals in 46 (92%) provinces. CP-Kpn was more prevalent in the blood (5.8%, 50/853) than in the urine (1.4%, 201/14,464). The cumulative incidence for both CP-Kpn and CP-Eco was 0.05 per 100 admitted patients. The main carbapenemase genes identified in CP-Kpn were bla OXA-48 (263/377), bla KPC-3 (62/377), bla VIM-1 (28/377), and bla NDM-1 (12/377). All isolates were susceptible to at least two antibiotics. Interregional dissemination of eight high-risk CP-Kpn clones was detected, mainly ST307/OXA-48 (16.4%), ST11/OXA-48 (16.4%), and ST512-ST258/KPC (13.8%). ST512/KPC and ST15/OXA-48 were the most frequent bacteremia-causative clones. The average number of acquired resistance genes was higher in CP-Kpn (7.9) than in CP-Eco (5.5). This study serves as a first step toward WGS integration in the surveillance of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales in Spain. We detected important epidemiological changes, including increased CP-Kpn and CP-Eco prevalence and incidence compared to previous studies, wide interregional dissemination, and increased dissemination of high-risk clones, such as ST307/OXA-48 and ST512/KPC-3.";2022;;Frontiers in microbiology;"Cañada-García JE; Moure Z; Sola-Campoy PJ; Delgado-Valverde M; Cano ME; Gijón D; González M; Gracia-Ahufinger I; Larrosa N; Mulet X; Pitart C; Rivera A; Bou G; Calvo J; Cantón R; González-López JJ; Martínez-Martínez L; Navarro F; Oliver A; Palacios-Baena ZR; Pascual Á; Ruiz-Carrascoso G; Vila J; Aracil B; Pérez-Vázquez M; Oteo-Iglesias J";"Cañada-García JE; Moure Z; Sola-Campoy PJ; Delgado-Valverde M; Cano ME; Gijón D; González M; Gracia-Ahufinger I; Larrosa N; Mulet X; Pitart C; Rivera A; Bou G; Calvo J; Cantón R; González-López JJ; Martínez-Martínez L; Navarro F; Oliver A; Palacios-Baena ZR; Pascual Á; Ruiz-Carrascoso G; Vila J; Aracil B; Pérez-Vázquez M; Oteo-Iglesias J.

To assess molecular changes that could be involved in erythromycin resistance trends by whole genome analysis of representative isolates. We collected antibiotic susceptibility data for all first-blood S. aureus isolates in patients from 47 Spanish hospitals according to EARS-Net criteria. MLSB antibiotic consumption was obtained from the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Medical Devices (2008-2020). We sequenced 137 representative isolates for core genome multilocus sequence typing, resistome and virulome analysis. For the 36,612 invasive S. aureus isolates, methicillin resistance decreased from 26.4% in 2004 to 22.4% in 2020. Erythromycin resistance in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) increased from 13.6% in 2004 to 28.9% in 2020 (p < 0.001); however, it decreased from 68.7 to 61.8% (p < 0.0001) in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Total consumption of MLSB antibiotics increased from 2.72 defined daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day (DID) in 2014 to 3.24 DID in 2016. By WGS, the macrolide resistance genes detected were erm (59.8%), msrA (46%), and mphC (45.2%). The erm genes were more prevalent in MSSA (44/57, 77.2%) than in MRSA (38/80, 47.5%). Most of the erm genes identified in MSSA after 2013 differed from the predominant ermC gene (17/22, 77.3%), largely because ermT was significantly associated with MSSA after 2013 (11/29, 37.9%). All 13 ermT isolates in this study, except one, belonged to ST398 and came from 10 hospitals and six Spanish provinces. The significant increase in erythromycin resistance in blood MSSA correlated with the consumption of the MLSB antibiotics in Spain. These preliminary data seem support the hypothesis that the human ST398 MSSA clade with ermT-mediated resistance to erythromycin may be involved in this trend.";2023;;Frontiers in microbiology;"El Mammery A; Ramírez de Arellano E; Cañada-García JE; Cercenado E; Villar-Gómara L; Casquero-García V; García-Cobos S; Lepe JA; Ruiz de Gopegui Bordes E; Calvo-Montes J; Larrosa Escartín N; Cantón R; Pérez-Vázquez M; Aracil B; Oteo-Iglesias J";"El Mammery A; Ramírez de Arellano E; Cañada-García JE; Cercenado E; Villar-Gómara L; Casquero-García V; García-Cobos S; Lepe JA; Ruiz de Gopegui Bordes E; Calvo-Montes J; Larrosa Escartín N; Cantón R; Pérez-Vázquez M; Aracil B; Oteo-Iglesias J.

10.3389/fmicb.2023.1247804;The CARBA-MAP study: national mapping of carbapenemases in Spain (2014-2018).;Infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including isolates producing acquired carbapenemases, constitute a prevalent health problem worldwide. The primary objective of this study was to determine the distribution of the different carbapenemases among carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE, specifically Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae complex, and Klebsiella aerogenes) and carbapenemase-producing P. aeruginosa (CPPA) in Spain from January 2014 to December 2018. A national, retrospective, cross-sectional multicenter study was performed. The study included the first isolate per patient and year obtained from clinical samples and obtained for diagnosis of infection in hospitalized patients. A structured questionnaire was completed by the participating centers using the REDCap platform, and results were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 29.0.0. A total of 2,704 carbapenemase-producing microorganisms were included, for which the type of carbapenemase was determined in 2692 cases: 2280 CPE (84.7%) and 412 CPPA (15.3%), most often using molecular methods and immunochromatographic assays. Globally, the most frequent types of carbapenemase in Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa were OXA-48-like, alone or in combination with other enzymes (1,523 cases, 66.8%) and VIM (365 cases, 88.6%), respectively. Among Enterobacterales, carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae was reported in 1821 cases (79.9%), followed by E. cloacae complex in 334 cases (14.6%). In Enterobacterales, KPC is mainly present in the South and South-East regions of Spain and OXA-48-like in the rest of the country. Regarding P. aeruginosa, VIM is widely distributed all over the country. Globally, an increasing percentage of OXA-48-like enzymes was observed from 2014 to 2017. KPC enzymes were more frequent in 2017-2018 compared to 2014-2016. Data from this study help to understand the situation and evolution of the main species of CPE and CPPA in Spain, with practical implications for control and optimal treatment of infections caused by these multi-drug resistant organisms.;2023;;Frontiers in microbiology;"Gracia-Ahufinger I; López-González L; Vasallo FJ; Galar A; Siller M; Pitart C; Bloise I; Torrecillas M; Gijón-Cordero D; Viñado B; Castillo-García J; Campo R; Mulet X; Madueño-Alonso A; Chamizo-López FJ; Arrastia-Erviti M; Galán-Sánchez F; Fernández-Quejo M; Rodríguez-Díaz JC; Gutiérrez-Zufiaurre MN; Rodríguez-Maresca MA; Ortega-Lafont MDP; Yagüe-Guirao G; Chaves-Blanco L; Colomina-Rodríguez J; Vidal-Acuña MR; Portillo ME; Franco-Álvarez de Luna F; Centelles-Serrano MJ; Azcona-Gutiérrez JM; Delgado-Iribarren García Campero A; Rey-Cao S; Muñoz P; Calvo-Montes J; Zboromyrska Y; Grandioso D; Càmara J; Cantón R; Larrosa-Escartín N; Díaz-Regañón J; Martínez-Martínez L";"Gracia-Ahufinger I; López-González L; Vasallo FJ; Galar A; Siller M; Pitart C; Bloise I; Torrecillas M; Gijón-Cordero D; Viñado B; Castillo-García J; Campo R; Mulet X; Madueño-Alonso A; Chamizo-López FJ; Arrastia-Erviti M; Galán-Sánchez F; Fernández-Quejo M; Rodríguez-Díaz JC; Gutiérrez-Zufiaurre MN; Rodríguez-Maresca MA; Ortega-Lafont MDP; Yagüe-Guirao G; Chaves-Blanco L; Colomina-Rodríguez J; Vidal-Acuña MR; Portillo ME; Franco-Álvarez de Luna F; Centelles-Serrano MJ; Azcona-Gutiérrez JM; Delgado-Iribarren García Campero A; Rey-Cao S; Muñoz P; Calvo-Montes J; Zboromyrska Y; Grandioso D; Càmara J; Cantón R; Larrosa-Escartín N; Díaz-Regañón J; Martínez-Martínez L.

10.3389/fmicb.2023.1270999;The balance between antibiotic resistance and fitness/virulence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: an update on basic knowledge and fundamental research.;The interplay between antibiotic resistance and bacterial fitness/virulence has attracted the interest of researchers for decades because of its therapeutic implications, since it is classically assumed that resistance usually entails certain biological costs. Reviews on this topic revise the published data from a general point of view, including studies based on clinical strains or in vitro-evolved mutants in which the resistance phenotype is seen as a final outcome, i.e., a combination of mechanisms. However, a review analyzing the resistance/fitness balance from the basic research perspective, compiling studies in which the different resistance pathways and respective biological costs are individually approached, was missing. Here we cover this gap, specifically focusing on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a pathogen that stands out because of its extraordinary capacity for resistance development and for which a considerable number of recent and particular data on the interplay with fitness/virulence have been released. The revised information, split into horizontally-acquired vs. mutation-driven resistance, suggests a great complexity and even controversy in the resistance-fitness/virulence balance in the acute infection context, with results ranging from high costs linked to certain pathways to others that are seemingly cost-free or even cases of resistance mechanisms contributing to increased pathogenic capacities. The elusive mechanistic basis for some enigmatic data, knowledge gaps, and possibilities for therapeutic exploitation are discussed. The information gathered suggests that resistance-fitness/virulence interplay may be a source of potential antipseudomonal targets and thus, this review poses the elementary first step for the future development of these strategies harnessing certain resistance-associated biological burdens.;2023;;Frontiers in microbiology;"Jordana-Lluch E; Barceló IM; Escobar-Salom M; Estévez MA; Zamorano L; Gómez-Zorrilla S; Sendra E; Oliver A; Juan C";"Jordana-Lluch E; Barceló IM; Escobar-Salom M; Estévez MA; Zamorano L; Gómez-Zorrilla S; Sendra E; Oliver A; Juan C.

10.3390/antibiotics11091212;Carbapenem Combinations for Infections Caused by Carbapenemase-Producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa: Experimental In Vitro and In Vivo Analysis.;In the context of difficult-to-treat carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, we evaluated imipenem, meropenem, and doripenem combinations against eleven carbapenemase-producing P. aeruginosa isolates. According to the widespread global distribution of high-risk clones and carbapenemases, four representative isolates were selected: ST175 (OXA-2/VIM-20), ST175 (VIM-2), ST235 (GES-5), and ST111 (IMP-33), for efficacy studies using a sepsis murine model. Minimum inhibitory concentration (mg/L) ranges were 64-256 for imipenem and 16-128 for meropenem and doripenem. In vitro, imipenem plus meropenem was synergistic against 72% of isolates and doripenem plus meropenem or imipenem against 55% and 45%, respectively. All combinations were synergistic against the ST175, ST235, and ST155 clones. In vivo, meropenem diminished the spleen and blood bacterial concentrations of four and three isolates, respectively, with better efficacy than imipenem or doripenem. The combinations did not show efficacy compared with the more active monotherapies, except for imipenem plus meropenem, which reduced the ST235 bacterial spleen concentration. Mortality decreased with imipenem plus meropenem or doripenem for the ST175 isolate. Results suggest that carbapenem combinations are not an alternative for severe infections by carbapenemase-producing P. aeruginosa. Meropenem monotherapy showed in vivo efficacy despite its high MIC, probably because its dosage allowed a sufficient antimicrobial exposure at the infection sites.;2022;Sep;Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland);"Herrera-Espejo S; Del Barrio-Tofiño E; Cebrero-Cangueiro T; López-Causapé C; Álvarez-Marín R; Cisneros JM; Pachón J; Oliver A; Pachón-Ibáñez ME";"Herrera-Espejo S; Del Barrio-Tofiño E; Cebrero-Cangueiro T; López-Causapé C; Álvarez-Marín R; Cisneros JM; Pachón J; Oliver A; Pachón-Ibáñez ME.

10.3390/antibiotics11111456;Suboptimal Concentrations of Ceftazidime/Avibactam (CAZ-AVI) May Select for CAZ-AVI Resistance in Extensively Drug-Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa: In Vivo and In Vitro Evidence.;This study correlates in vivo findings in a patient with an extensively drug-resistant (XDR) P. aeruginosa infection who developed resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI) with in vitro results of a 7-day hollow-fiber infection model (HFIM) testing the same bacterial strain. The patient was critically ill with ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by XDR P. aeruginosa ST175 with CAZ-AVI MIC of 6 mg/L and was treated with CAZ-AVI in continuous infusion at doses adjusted for renal function. Plasma concentrations of CAZ-AVI were analyzed on days 3, 7, and 10. In the HIFM, the efficacy of different steady-state concentrations (Css) of CAZ-AVI (12, 18, 30 and 48 mg/L) was evaluated. In both models, a correlation was observed between the decreasing plasma levels of CAZ-AVI and the emergence of resistance. In the HIFM, a Css of 30 and 48 mg/L (corresponding to 5× and 8× MIC) had a bactericidal effect without selecting resistant mutants, whereas a Css of 12 and 18 mg/L (corresponding to 2× and 3× MIC) failed to prevent the emergence of resistance. CAZ/AVI resistance development was caused by the selection of a single ampC mutation in both patient and HFIM. Until further data are available, strategies to achieve plasma CAZ-AVI levels at least 4× MIC could be of interest, particularly in severe and high-inoculum infections caused by XDR P. aeruginosa with high CAZ-AVI MICs.;2022;Oct;Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland);"Lopez-Montesinos I; Montero MM; Domene-Ochoa S; López-Causapé C; Echeverria D; Sorlí L; Campillo N; Luque S; Padilla E; Prim N; Grau S; Oliver A; Horcajada JP";"Lopez-Montesinos I; Montero MM; Domene-Ochoa S; López-Causapé C; Echeverria D; Sorlí L; Campillo N; Luque S; Padilla E; Prim N; Grau S; Oliver A; Horcajada JP.

10.3390/ijms23158127;Effects of Inhaled Corticosteroids on the Innate Immunological Response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infection in Patients with COPD.;Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) use is associated with an increased risk of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection in patients with COPD. We aimed to evaluate the effects of ICS on alveolar macrophages in response to PA in COPD patients with and without baseline ICS treatment (COPD and COPD + ICS, respectively) as well as smoker and nonsmoker controls. To do so, cells were infected with PA and cotreated with budesonide (BUD) or fluticasone propionate (FLU). The analysis of NF-κB and c-jun activity revealed a significant increase in both factors in response to PA cotreated with BUD/FLU in smokers but not in COPD or COPD + ICS patients when compared with PA infection alone. The expression of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and the transcription factor c-jun were induced upon PA infection in nonsmokers only. Moreover, in the smoker and COPD groups, there was a significant increase in TLR2 and a decrease in c-jun expression when treated with BUD/FLU after PA infection, which were not observed in COPD + ICS patients. Therefore, the chronic use of ICS seemingly makes the macrophages tolerant to BUD/FLU stimulation compared with those from patients not treated with ICS, promoting an impaired recognition of PA and activity of alveolar macrophages in terms of altered expression of TLR2 and cytokine production, which could explain the increased risk of PA infection in COPD patients under ICS treatment.;2022;Jul;International journal of molecular sciences;"Cerón-Pisa N; Shafiek H; Martín-Medina A; Verdú J; Jordana-Lluch E; Escobar-Salom M; Barceló IM; López-Causapé C; Oliver A; Juan C; Iglesias A; Cosío BG";"Cerón-Pisa N; Shafiek H; Martín-Medina A; Verdú J; Jordana-Lluch E; Escobar-Salom M; Barceló IM; López-Causapé C; Oliver A; Juan C; Iglesias A; Cosío BG.

However, good quality data and adequate surveillance systems are required to contribute to meaningful surveillance in public health. In this context, the network of Spanish laboratories for coronavirus (RELECOV) was created with the main goal of promoting actions to speed up the detection, analyses, and evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 at a national level, partially structured and financed by an ECDC-HERA-Incubator action (ECDC/GRANT/2021/024). A SARS-CoV-2 sequencing quality control assessment (QCA) was developed to evaluate the network's technical capacity. QCA full panel results showed a lower hit rate for lineage assignment compared to that obtained for variants. Genomic data comprising 48,578 viral genomes were studied and evaluated to monitor SARS-CoV-2. The developed network actions showed a 36% increase in sharing viral sequences. In addition, analysis of lineage/sublineage-defining mutations to track the virus showed characteristic mutation profiles for the Delta and Omicron variants. Further, phylogenetic analyses strongly correlated with different variant clusters, obtaining a robust reference tree. The RELECOV network has made it possible to improve and enhance the genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain.

10.3390/microorganisms11102486;Mutation Analysis in Regulator DNA-Binding Regions for Antimicrobial Efflux Pumps in 17,000 Pseudomonas aeruginosa Genomes.;Mutations leading to upregulation of efflux pumps can produce multiple drug resistance in the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Changes in their DNA binding regions, i.e., palindromic operators, can compromise pump depression and subsequently enhance resistance against several antibacterials and biocides. Here, we have identified (pseudo)palindromic repeats close to promoters of genes encoding 13 core drug-efflux pumps of P. aeruginosa. This framework was applied to detect mutations in these repeats in 17,292 genomes. Eighty-nine percent of isolates carried at least one mutation. Eight binary genetic properties potentially related to expression were calculated for mutations. These included palindromicity reduction, mutation type, positioning within the repeat and DNA-bending shift. High-risk ST298, ST308 and ST357 clones commonly carried four conserved mutations while ST175 and the cystic fibrosis-linked ST649 clones showed none. Remarkably, a T-to-C transition in the fourth position of the upstream repeat for mexEF-oprN was nearly exclusive of the high-risk ST111 clone. Other mutations were associated with high-risk sublineages using sample geotemporal metadata. Moreover, 1.5% of isolates carried five or more mutations suggesting they undergo an alternative program for regulation of their effluxome. Overall, P. aeruginosa shows a wide range of operator mutations with a potential effect on efflux pump expression and antibiotic resistance.;2023;Oct;Microorganisms;"Pérez-Vázquez M; López-Causapé C; Corral-Lugo A; McConnell MJ; Oteo-Iglesias J; Oliver A; Martín-Galiano AJ";"Pérez-Vázquez M; López-Causapé C; Corral-Lugo A; McConnell MJ; Oteo-Iglesias J; Oliver A; Martín-Galiano AJ.

10.3390/s22051880;Improving the Quantification of Colorimetric Signals in Paper-Based Immunosensors with an Open-Source Reader.;Measuring the colorimetric signals produced by the biospecific accumulation of colorimetric probes and recording the results is a key feature for next-generation paper-based rapid tests. Manual processing of these tests is time-consuming and prone to a loss of accuracy when interpreting faint and patchy signals. Proprietary, closed-source readers and software companies offering automated smartphone-based assay readings have both been criticized for interoperability issues. Here, we introduce a minimal reader prototype composed of open-source hardware and open-source software that has the benefits of automatic assay quantification while avoiding the interoperability issues associated with closed-source readers. An image-processing algorithm was developed to automate the selection of an optimal region of interest and measure the average pixel intensity. When used to quantify signals produced by lateral flow immunoassays for detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, results obtained with the proposed algorithm were comparable to those obtained with a manual method but with the advantage of improving the precision and accuracy when quantifying small spots or faint and patchy signals.;2022;Feb;Sensors (Basel, Switzerland);"Russell SM; Alba-Patiño A; Vaquer A; Clemente A; de la Rica R";"Russell SM; Alba-Patiño A; Vaquer A; Clemente A; de la Rica R.

10.37201/req/098.2023;In vitro activity of cefiderocol and other newly approved antimicrobials against multi-drug resistant Gram-negative pathogens recovered in intensive care units in Spain and Portugal.;The antimicrobial resistance is a significant public health threat, particularly for healthcare-associated infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens which are increasingly reported worldwide. The aim of this study was to provide data on the in vitro antimicrobial activity of cefiderocol and that of commercially available comparator antibiotics against a defined collection of recent clinical multi-drug resistant (MDR) microorganisms, including carbapenem resistant Gram-negative bacteria collected from different regions in Spain and Portugal. A total of 477 clinical isolates of Enterobacterales, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were prospectively (n=265) and retrospectively (n=212) included (2016-2019). Susceptibility testing was performed using standard broad microdilution and results were interpreted using CLSI-2021 and EUCAST-2021 criteria. Overall, cefiderocol showed a good activity against Enterobacterales isolates, being 99.5% susceptible by CLSI and 94.5% by EUCAST criteria. It also demonstrated excellent activity against P. aeruginosa and S. maltophilia isolates, all being susceptible to this compound considering CLSI breakpoints. Regarding A. baumannii (n=64), only one isolate was resistant to cefiderocol. Our results are in agreement with other studies performed outside Spain and Portugal highlighting its excellent activity against MDR gram-negative bacteria. Cefiderocol is a therapeutic alternative to those available for the treatment of infections caused by these MDR bacteria.;2024;Feb;Revista espanola de quimioterapia : publicacion oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Quimioterapia;"Gijón D; García-Castillo J; Fernández-López MC; Bou G; Siller M; Calvo-Montes J; Pitart C; Vila J; Torno N; Gimeno C; Cruz H; Ramos H; Mulet X; Oliver A; Ruiz-Garbajosa P; Canton R";"Gijón D; García-Castillo J; Fernández-López MC; Bou G; Siller M; Calvo-Montes J; Pitart C; Vila J; Torno N; Gimeno C; Cruz H; Ramos H; Mulet X; Oliver A; Ruiz-Garbajosa P; Canton R.
